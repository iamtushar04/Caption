Field of the InventionThe field of the invention relates to bicycle systems, especially to bicycle systems adapted for use with smartphones, to smartphones configured for use with bicycle systems, and to methods and to computer software for use with such bicycle systems or smartphones, and to servers configured to communicate with such bicycle systems or smartphones.2. Technical BackgroundTechnological advancements have enhanced most modern day forms of transportation. For example, in the current smart-phone-centric society, operators and passengers of automobiles and airplanes have had their commute enriched with applications that enable users to tailor their experience. In contrast, the bicycle has remained comparatively primitive.3. Discussion of Related ArtThere have been developments in accessories that allow the usage of electronic devices, such as GPS systems or smart phones on a bicycle. However, these developments have typically been modular in nature and require that a user bolt on a GPS system to a bicycle or bolt on a docking system for a smart phone. There have even been developments to security systems for bicycles to allow tracking. The problem is that all of these accessories are separate from the bicycle and need to be added to a bicycle as a retro-fit. When these items are retro-fitted to a bike, durability and security become an issue. These accessories can be easily broken or stolen as they are simply bolted onto the bicycle. Further, each time an accessory is added, the bicycle becomes less aerodynamic and speed of the bicycle can be adversely affected. Here there are disclosed solutions to these problems by integrating accessories into the bicycle in a manner that they are all contained within the bicycle and it is not possible (or it is possible only with difficulty) for them to be broken off, stolen, or to interfere with the performance of the bicycle.Bicycles and smart phones exist independently in our society, and each is used in some manner to plan and complete trips from point A to point B. Here there are disclosed solutions which fully integrate the two. Additionally, the solutions offer a technology-based approach to protecting and maintaining the bicycle.The solutions disclosed herein relate to a bicycle's frame-embedded nervous system and provide the user with a fully interactive cycling experience. A handlebar integrated docking system allows the rider to customize and manage his trip âon the go.â Currently, a cyclist should turn off and stow his smartphone while operating a bicycle. Additionally, if a cyclist is unfamiliar with his location or gets lost in search of a destination, he should pull over and either check a map or ask for directions. Moreover, while bike locks currently do exist, they are independent, basic, detached devices. The solutions disclosed herein truly bring the bicycle into the 21st Century, and are designed with the tech-savvy, urban rider in mind.The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not intended to be, and are not to be construed as, statements or admissions of common general knowledge in the art. In particular, the above prior art discussion might not relate to what is commonly or well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists in the understanding of the inventive steps of the solutions disclosed herein of which the identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a bicycle system including a bicycle, the bicycle system including a processor integral to the bicycle, the bicycle system further including a battery integral to the bicycle, wherein the processor is powerable by the battery, the bicycle system including a smartphone holder configurable to receive a smartphone and to connect the smartphone to the processor, wherein in use the smartphone holder is attachable to, and detachable from, the smartphone.

The first level is a bolt lock integrated into the bicycle's bottom bracket which is deactivated when the cyclist places an electronic device, such as a smart phone, into the handlebar-integrated docking system, and is activated when the device is undocked. The lock may contain a support bracket and a moveable, spring-loaded clamp. The second level of security is a frame-integrated, retractable cable. This cable can be used to secure the bicycle to bike racks, light poles, and other street furniture. Both the lock and the cable can detect theft attempts, trigger on-board electric alarms, and alert the bicycle system owner.The bicycle system may further comprise an integrated energy generation, storage, and charging system. The energy system consists of front and rear hubs and a front hub integrated kinetic generators, frame-embedded batteries, and an on-frame charging port. The primary power storage unit may be a lithium ion battery which, when progressively charged by said kinetic generators, ensures all-day, full-system performance. While the lithium battery is preferred, one skilled in the art will recognize that other battery types may also be possible. However, the bicycle system contains an on-frame DC charging port in the event the battery becomes discharged due to prolonged non-use.The bicycle system may further comprise a fully-integrated frame-embedded electronics system. The electronics system may comprise an application processor, transceiver module, wired or wireless technology, such as Bluetooth, Near field communication (NFC), etc., system memory, rider-accessible flash memory, user interface, and sensor processor which controls bicycle system features such as the CVT, smart battery charger, gyroscope, Electrocardiography (EKG) sensor, and a fully-integrated lighting system. It is anticipated that the electronics may be able to control any number of desired features and that the list of features is in no way limited by the above listing. The lighting system comprises white stem projection lights, side bar indicator lights, front and rear, dual-sided notice-of-presence lights, seat notice-of-presence lights, and right-sided CVT buttons. It is preferred that any number of lights be utilized on the bicycle frame to achieve desired results for a user. The lighting system and its accompanying lights provide high visibility and increased awareness to other road users which increases safety to the user and his/her surroundings.The application processor may control vibrating haptic feedback to the rider, the bicycle kickstand, cable lock, horn, locking mechanism, and the detection of the presence of the user's smart phone on the handlebar-mounted docking system. To further enhance the user experience, the bicycle may also be equipped with an advanced sensor array which provides a range of ambient data including, but not limited to, carbon monoxide levels, temperature readings, humidity, light and noise levels as well as physical data such as heading, velocity, acceleration, and orientation. When the bicycle system takes its own range of ambient data, the readings are more accurate than what a user may find when looking up data remotely.Customized, user-friendly control of the aforementioned features may be achieved via an application on the user's smart phone that may sync to and communicate with the bicycle system upon docking to the handlebar-integrated docking station. A user is also able to communicate with the bicycle system when the electronic device is not docked by using mobile communication networks. Features, such as mapping and turn-by-turn navigation, are then accessible to the rider while the bicycle system is in operation. All the while, the bicycle system may utilize haptics and provide audible notices to the user to ensure optimum safety.An integration point between the user and a solution disclosed herein is the handlebar-integrated smart phone docking station. The user is able to download and install an application on an electronic device to be identified by the bicycle system's recognition software when placed into the docking station after an initial registration and syncing process is completed. One skilled in the art will recognize that the electronic device is preferred to be a smart mobile phone or other similar electronic device so long as it is capable of sending or receiving information. When recognized as the owner's smart phone, the bicycle system-embedded software may launch and display a customizable âWelcome screenâ on the face of the smart phone. If a potential user attempts to place a non-registered device on the bicycle system, an âUnauthorized screenâ may pop-up on the device and a signal may be sent to the registered owner's registered device warning of a potential theft. Additionally, the registered owner can program the bicycle system's horn and lights to activate in an alarming manner when a non-registered device is docked. Similarly, the registered owner can program the bicycle system's horn and lights to activate if the kickstand is retracted or if the cable lock is cut without the registered device on the docking station.If a registered device is recognized by the embedded software via the docking station, the user may be prompted to Sign In. After a recognized ID and password are entered, the bicycle system's navigation screen may appear on the docked device. The first time a recognized device is docked on a calendar day, the âWarning Screenâ appears, providing common sense cycling safety advice. After the âWarning Screenâ is manually dismissed by the user, the âBike Stoppedâ screen is displayed and the bicycle system is ready for use. Upon movement, the âBike Stoppedâ screen is replaced by the âBike in Motionâ screen. This solution's motion-recognition software detects motion and hides/shows elements differently when riding versus when stopped. For example, detailed maps are displayed when the bike is stopped, while bike speed is displayed while the bike is in motion. Moreover, screen input is locked when bike motion is detected to ensure safe, non-distracted, riding.Another feature of the solution is the on-board navigation system which uses haptic feedback to relay directions. For example, from a stopped position, the user can program a desired destination into the docked device; in turn, the bicycle system's navigation system may calculate and show the route on the screen of the docked device. Once the user begins to move, the âBike in Motionâ screen may engage and display directional arrows to guide the cyclist to the entered destination. When turns are required, vibration motors embedded within the handlebar grips signal the correct direction to the cyclist, e.g. the left hand grip rumbles twice indicating that cyclist needs to take the next left hand turn. Routes can also be re-calculated in instances where a user cycles off course.In a second example, a solution disclosed herein relates to the lock for linking an electronic device to an item comprising the item to be locked or unlocked, an electronic device, and a locking mechanism wherein the locking mechanism is linked to the electronic device. In an example, the lock is integrated into the bicycle system's bottom bracket and electronically connected to the docking station via the bicycle system's embedded software. When a registered device is placed on the handlebar-integrated docking system, and is recognized by the bicycle system's embedded software, the lock is disengaged and the bicycle system's crank axle is enabled to allow movement. The lock is engaged when the registered device is removed from the docking station. When the registered device is removed from the docking station, an electronic signal is sent to the lock and the spring-loaded, movable clamp is lowered onto the crank axle, disabling the axle and immobilizing the pedals.In instances where the bicycle system is stolen or the lock is tampered or broken, the bicycle system is able to notify a user's electronic device by sending a message regarding the status of the bicycle system or lock. The bicycle system may then also be able to transmit its location to a user's electronic device which is a major theft deterrent.This and other examples will be more thoroughly realized with reference to the drawings and detailed description below.A bicycle system (1) may comprise a seamless frame (16), with a front hub (8), a rear hub (14), and a bottom bracket (10). The seat (2) and handlebar (6) may be adjustable to accommodate the individual user.The primary mechanism of accomplishing device to bike connectivity may be by placing an electronic device (5), in the handlebar-integrated docking system (4).The drivetrain's transmission (CVT) (21) may be integrated into the bicycle at the rear hub (14) and may utilize a carbon fiber belt (12) to deliver smoother, quieter operation than traditional chain systems. An example is shown inFIG. 1.A bicycle system (1) may feature an integrated lock that is activated and deactivated when the user places a smart phone, or similar device, on the docking station linked to the bicycle system (1). The lock may be connected to the bicycle system at crank axle (12a). An example is shown inFIGS. 2a, 2band2c.The lock (15) may be comprised of a support bracket (6z) and a spring-loaded, moveable clamp (11). The lock may attach to the bicycle system's crank axle (12a) at a locking point (2a) which is embedded within the bicycle system's bottom bracket (10). Springs (13a,13b) may provide a point of compression for the clamp (11) when it is either locked or unlocked.FIG. 2cdepicts an example of a lock in an engaged, locked state. The lock (15) may receive a lock signal from an electronic device (5) which causes the clamp (11) to move into position around the axle (12a). When the lock is engaged, the pedal cranks (4a,4b) are disabled and cannot be moved. This in turn causes the bicycle system movement to be disabled.FIG. 2bdepicts an example of a lock in a disengaged, unlocked state. To disengage, the lock (15) may receive an unlock signal from an electronic device (5) which causes the clamp (11) to move upward to release the axle (12a).In an example, a bicycle system has been designed to enhance the user experience. The main interaction between user and bicycle occurs at the handlebar. Integrated into the handlebar is the docking station (4) for the user's electronic device (5). The electronic device (5), provides on-screen control and feedback information to the user, and contains such features as a CVT indicator (7), for example, which indicates the current gearing of the bike. The handlebar further comprises right (6a) and left (6b) switches to control bicycle system features such as the right (8a) and left (8b) turn signals, the horn, the projection lights, the launch of the Bike App, or for switching the transmission from manual to automatic and vice versa. An example is shown inFIG. 3.There are provided Transmission Behavior and Handlebar Controls. CVT may be self-controlling with behavior inputs from the bike electronics. Handlebar switches may allow control of bike lighting, horn, transmission, and other functions. For navigation, an upcoming/current left turn indicator light (30a) may be provided. For navigation, an upcoming/current right turn indicator light (30b) may be provided. (âIndicator lightsâ are usually referred to as âturn signalsâ in US English). A Bike CVT Indicator (7) may be provided. Left hand switch (6b) may control a turn signal, a horn and a projection light. With the right switch, a single press may toggle a right turn signal on/off. With the right switch, a long press may toggle a projection light flashing function on/off. With a center switch, this may sound a horn as long as it is depressed. With a left switch, a single press may toggle a left turn signal on/off. With the left switch, a long press may toggle a projection light on/off. Haptic feedback in left hand grip (32a) may be provided for navigation turn indicators. Haptic feedback in right hand grip (32b) may be provided for navigation turn indicators. Haptic feedback may be provided on a corresponding side of a handlebar trigger as a turn approaches. Right hand switch (6a) may control transmission and bike app controls. A left switch may set transmission one selection softer (automatic) or down one gear (manual). A center switch, with a single press may switch between Automatic Transmission and Manual Transmission. A center switch, with a long press may launch a Bike app if not currently running a Bike app. A right switch may set transmission one selection harder (Automatic) or up one gear (Manual). Modes may be kept in App memory (bike should remember last setting). Switching between Automatic and Manual should aim to have a seamless ride style. App should launch in Automatic mode. Docking the bike may begin a registration check. After a smartphone is confirmed as valid, an ambient light sensor may turn on a projection light and NOP lights. An example is shown inFIG. 3.Turning toFIG. 4, an example of an electrical system for the bicycle system's nervous system is depicted. AndFIG. 5depicts an example of a corresponding power architecture.FIGS. 4 and 5set forth an example of a manner and order in which the various components of the embedded software system interact in order for the user's commands to result in various programmed outputs.In an example electrical system for a bicycle system, an application processor is in connection with GSM, GPS and Bluetooth+enhanced data rate (BT+EDR) antennae. The application processor is in connection with a USB Connector, system memory (including double data rate (DDR) and flash memory), system storage (including micro Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC)), a loud speaker, debug connectors (including RS-232, Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) and micro USB). The application processor is in connection with a power regeneration and management function. The application processor is connected to a sensor microcontroller (MCU) via universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver/transmitter (USART) and General-purpose input/output (GPIO) interfaces. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with debug connectors (including UART0 and JTAG). The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with a smartphone (eg. iphone) dock via a USB connection. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection via connections (eg. analogue to digital converters (ADC)) to an ambient light sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor and to a CO sensor. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with an accelerometer and magnetometer, a pressure/altimeter, a CVT, a smartphone authentication, a gyroscope, and to a biometric sensor. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with stem projection lights, side bar indicator lights, front left and front right NOP lights, rear left and rear right NOP lights, a saddle mount NOP light, CVT buttons, haptic feedback, a kickstand, a cable lock, lighting buttons, a piezo buzzer, and a crank lock. An example electrical system for a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 4.In an example of a power architecture of a bicycle system, output from a dynamo of the bicycle system is passed through a bridge rectifier and a bulk capacitor to a main system smart battery charger which provides for example asingle output12V charging voltage. Alternatively, power from an external AC to DC power supply, 19V to 24 V, 4 A, may be provided to the system battery charger when the bicycle system is stationary and locked. Output from the system battery charger is fed to the main system battery, eg. at 12V or at 16.8V. Main system battery output may be used at 7.4V for charging a secondary battery, which may store 2.2 Ahrs charge at 7.4V for supplying 5V, 1.5 A (2 A maximum) for a USB charging port via a USB current limiter. Main system battery output may provide output at 5V, 2.5 A (regulator) for powering a CO sensor, a LED lighting supply, or a crank lock stepper motor driver. Main system battery output may be used at 3.3V, 350 mA (regulator) for powering a sensor MCU, or sensors. Main system battery output may be used at 12V, 1 A for powering an automatic transmission. Main system battery output may be used at 3.8V, 2 A (regulator) to power a GSM/GPS unit, a Bluetooth interface and an application processor. An example of a power architecture of a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 5.FIGS. 6a(a),6a(b),6b(a) and6b(b) are software flowcharts, depicting examples of a step-by-step process for registering an unrecognized device in order to gain access to the bicycle (FIGS. 6a(a),6a(b)) and starting-up the bicycle with a previously-registered device (FIGS. 6b(a) and6b(b)).FIGS. 6b(a) and6b(b) further depict the appearance of the âWarning Screenâ, the âBike Stoppedâ screen, and the âBike in Motionâ screen.There is provided a server which provides smartphone applications for download.

In an example, there is provided a bicycle system which is the world's first bicycle system specifically created to extend and enhance the smartphone lifestyle. It may seamlessly integrate a smartphone with an elegant, innovative design to deliver a peerless balance of form and function-one we strongly believe will resonate with existing and future smartphone consumers alike. Examples are shown inFIGS. 7 to 16.In an example, the bicycle system begins with general consumer expectations of what a bicycle âisâ and then decidedly exceeds those expectations through its calculated fusion of performance, technology, ergonomics, dependability, safety, and aesthetics. In an example, the bicycle system propels cycling's evolution from its sporting/utilitarian roots to the vanguard of urban mobility. It signals âdiscreetly premiumâ and denotes âprofessional-gradeâ and âprecision instrumentâ-all while providing a ride unmatched for style, comfort, safety, and security.To deliver on this vision, we developed an example key-feature set specifically devised to ensure the project maintained its consumer-driven focus. Here we walk you through each of these key features, providing detailed insight into the deliberate and thorough nature of each feature's development and its contribution to the whole. We hope you find the following both informative and enjoyable.FeaturesIn an example, the bicycle system is a sophisticated, smartphone-enhanced urban bicycle. In an example, the bicycle system's sophistication derives from combining a smartphone with a host of features specifically devised to deliver an unprecedented user experience.ConnectivityIn an example, the bicycle system seamlessly connects with any authenticated smartphone eg. aniPhoneâ¢4 or 5 device running iOS 6.x or a later version, in a number of innovative ways.SpringPortâ¢In an example, SpringPortâthe bicycle system's primary mechanism of accomplishing Device-to-bike connectivityâis an elegant, handlebar-integrated docking station. It envelops âSpringPortedâ Devices within the IP65-rated, moisture, dust, and vibration free environment created by a machined aluminum body with LexanÂ® optical grade, touch-compliant cover and silicone seals. (The IP Code, International Protection Marking, IEC standard 60529, sometimes interpreted as Ingress Protection Marking, classifies and rates the degree of protection provided against the intrusion (including body parts such as hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. It is published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)).In an example, the bicycle system ships with interchangeable trays (eg. polycarbonate trays) that allow users to easily adapt SpringPort for use with current Device models. Moreover, in an example, tray designs are readily updatable to maintain compatibility with future smartphone device form factors. In an example, âSpringPortingâ a smartphone Device is effortless, and once completed, prompts a series of auto-executed tasks, examples of which include:Discovering the Device's unique identifying code.Connecting the Device to the bicycle system's ânervous systemâ.Deactivating the bicycle system's theft deterrence system.Launching the bicycle system's companion smartphone application.Determining the Device's battery state and initiating charging if required.FIG. 17andFIG. 18show an example of a handlebar-integrated docking station receiving a smartphone for docking with a bicycle system.SpringSmartâ¢In an example, once âSpringPortedâ, a Device gains access to SpringSmart, the bicycle system's frame-embedded nervous system. SpringSmart elements may include:Processor (e.g. ARM CPU running MFi authentication)Transceiver module (eg. including BTLE, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, GPS, and HSPA+)Powered, multiband antennaMicro-SDHC system memoryRider-accessible flash memorySpringSmart may also incorporate SpringSenseâ¢, an advanced sensor array providing a range of ambient data, including e.g. carbon monoxide, temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels, as well as physical data, such as heading, velocity, acceleration, and orientation.In an example, the bicycle system achieves an ultra-low power budget due, primarily, to SpringSmart's robust systems management capabilities. SpringSmart safeguards its sensors, allowing application access only to the extent needed, thus permitting the balance to remain dormant. In an example, SpringSmart also powers its antennas only to the precise degree required by active applications. An example is shown inFIG. 19, which shows schematically that an electronics system architecture ofFIG. 4forms an integral part of a bicycle system.SpringAppâ¢In an example, SpringApp is the bicycle system's companion smartphone application. Following download, in an example, its Sync feature allows new users to couple a specific Device to a specific bicycle system. After syncing, users gain access to the full SpringApp feature set, which may include:SyncDevice pairing to additional bikes/unpairing from a specific bike.ShareCustomizable, eco-friendly bicycle system sharing with guest users, enabling a primary user to retain admin level control over security features while managing the type of access guest users are granted.FindCycling-centric, turn-by-turn navigation (âTBTNâ).Lost/stolen bicycle system tracking.Remote theft alarm activation.StatusAccess to data concerning the state of key components and recommendations to users concerning the maintenance of each request for remote assistance with bicycle system systems issues.Examples of Bicycle System SpringApp FeaturesWhen an App for a bicycle system starts to run on a smartphone docked with the bicycle system, the App may begin by displaying a splash screen. An example is shown inFIG. 20a. The App may display a warning screen, asking the user to travel safely on the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 20b. A Home Screen may be displayed if the bicycle system is stationary. An example is shown inFIG. 20c. A different Home Screen may be displayed if the bicycle system is in motion. An example is shown inFIG. 20d. A Home Screen may display one or more of a speedometer, calories calculated to have been burned by a user of the bicycle system, a ride timer, a CO meter reading, an altimeter reading and a Tab bar. An example is shown inFIG. 21. The App may display a frost alert. An example is shown inFIG. 22a. The App may display a frost warning, which may be displayed until frost conditions have cleared. An example is shown inFIG. 22b. The App may display a CO Warning. An example is shown inFIG. 23a. The App may display a CO Alert. The CO Alert may have a coloured background eg. an orange background. An example is shown inFIG. 23b. The App may display a CO Timer which may indicate that a CO Warning has persisted beyond a predefined time interval. The CO Timer may have a coloured background eg. a red background. An example is shown inFIG. 23c. The App may display dual warnings eg. a CO Warning and a Frost Warning. An example is shown inFIG. 23d. The App may display an alert using a modified version of a smartphone icon associated with the App. An example is shown inFIG. 24. An SMS alert relating to the bicycle system may be provided to the user of a smartphone associated with the bicycle system. The SMS alert may identify the bicycle system and include some SMS message text. An example is shown inFIG. 25. An App Notification relating to the bicycle system may be provided to the user of a smartphone associated with the bicycle system. The App Notification may identify the bicycle system and include some text. An example is shown inFIG. 26. A Home Screen may provide Tab bar alerts. An example is shown inFIG. 27a. An App Find Screen may provide a notification list of notifications relating to the bicycle system with which the smartphone running the App is associated. An example is shown inFIG. 27b. A status screen may be provided by the App which lists maintenance-related notifications. An example is shown inFIG. 27c.Made for the Bicycle SystemThird party developers may be provided an SDK (software development kit) for designing bicycle system-ready applications in addition to SpringApp. A flourishing application market may enhance user experience and serve to further expand smartphones to new markets via an entirely unexpected path. Applications certified as âMade for âbicycle system Cââ (or, âMfCâ), may be published on the bicycle system's âApplication Marketplaceâ site and on SpringApp, with summaries and reviews, and the ability for users to download applications directly from the two locations. Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system may be provided. Such Apps may be searchable as a category of Apps by a user using the smartphone. A list of such apps may be provided in response to a search of the category of Apps using the smartphone.FIG. 28(left hand side) shows an example of a list of Apps that has been generated on a smartphone in response to a search of a category of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system.FIG. 28further shows an example of screen output (right hand side) from an App which is first in a list (left hand side) of Apps that has been generated on a smartphone in response to a search of a category of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system. Advertisements for Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system may be provided in a list of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system.PowerIn an example, the bicycle system possesses not only the unique capacity to power its electrical systems, but also the ability to simultaneously charge a SpringPorted Device. Moreover, in the unlikely event a bicycle system has not been ridden in a while, a user can take comfort in the fact that a bicycle system's on-board power generation capabilities may be supplemented with an included AC/DC power charger and on-frame DC charge point.SpringSparcâ¢In an example, SpringSparc is a bicycle system's ingenious energy generation, storage, and charging system. It includes front and rear hub-integrated kinetic generators, frame-embedded batteries, and an on-frame charging port.In an example, SpringSparc's primary power storage unit is a 50 W lithium ion battery. A fully charged primary battery may power the bicycle system for six hours without interim charging. When progressively charged via SpringSparc's kinetic generators, the primary battery may ensure all-day, full-system performance. However, should the primary unit become completely discharged due to prolonged storage, in an example it may be brought rapidly to functional levels via SpringSparc's on-frame DC charging point and supplied, country-specific, AC/DC12V/90 W charger.In an example of a power management system of a bicycle system, output from a dynamo of the bicycle system is passed through a bridge rectifier and a bulk capacitor to a system battery charger which provides for example asingle output12V charging voltage. Alternatively, power from an external AC to DC power supply, 19V to 24 V, DC, 4 A, may be provided to the system battery charger when the bicycle system is stationary and locked. Output from the system battery charger is fed to the main system battery, at 12V or at 16.8V. Main system battery output may be used at 5V, 1.5 A (regulator) for smartphone charging, or for power output to a USB connector, or to a lighting connector. Main system battery output may be used at 5V, 1.5 A (regulator) for powering a CO sensor, a LED lighting supply, a speaker or a crank lock. Main system battery output may be used at 3.3V, 400 mA (regulator) for powering a sensor MCU, sensors, LED drivers, or a Hall Effect sensor. Main system battery output may be used at 18V-20V, 500 mA (regulator) for powering an automatic transmission. Main system battery output may be used to power a GSM/GPS battery charger (dual output 3.7V charging voltage); such output may also power an application processor. An example of a power management system of a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 30.A bicycle system may include a power management system.FIG. 29shows a schematic example of a bicycle system which includes an example of a power management system of a bicycle system, as shown inFIG. 30.In an example, SpringSparc's secondary battery is a 5 W unit specifically designated to provide MFi-compliant power to SpringPorted Devices for both on-board use and charging purposes. In an example, in terms of order of charging, the primary battery is charged initially, followed by the secondary battery, which then powers/charges a SpringPorted Device. In an example, SpringSmart gives SpringSparc's 2 W tertiary battery extra attention by trickle charging and conditioning it to maintain optimal performance levels at all times. This is beneficial due to the battery's role in supporting lost/stolen bicycle system tracking provided by SpringApp's âFindâ feature, as successful location could take several days due to the variety and quantity of factors that can affect GSM and GPS signal transmission and reception.As previously mentioned, in an example, SpringSmart controls all SpringSense sensors and ensures low power consumption by activating/deactivating sensors as needed. Additionally SpringApp may display real-time battery state, charging progress, and time-to-depletion information, along with Device battery levels. An example of display on a smartphone by an App of a smartphone battery state and of a bicycle system battery state is shown inFIG. 31.PerformanceLuxury, premium, and aspirational consumers (âLPACsâ) have grown too sophisticated to tolerate the hollow promises proffered by âform over functionâ. Indeed, LPACs are well aware that design is not enough, and that âpretty is as pretty doesâ applies as readily to products as it does to people. Which is why, for each of the countless hours dedicated to developing the bicycle system's elegant form, an equal measure was devoted to its functionality. The bicycle system represents a new class of urban transport.DrivetrainIn an example, the bicycle system's SpringDriveâ¢ delivers ride quality and utility. In an example, SpringDrive comprises one, two or three of three key components:Rear hub-integrated continuously variable transmission (âCVTâ) providing step-less, automatic torque control, as well as optional manual âgear shiftâ cadence adjustment.Carbon fiber belt delivering smoother, quieter operation than traditional chain systems, while providing all of a chain's efficiency without the associated mess and maintenance.Custom designed and meticulously engineered sprocket and pulley profiles, finished with a nanotech coating specifically formulated to provide unparalleled durability in even the harshest environments.An example is shown inFIG. 32.AdjustabilitySpringFlexâ¢ is a mechanism offering three possible handlebar orientations:âComfortâ for rider-upright, low-to-mid velocitiesâSpeedâ for rider-forward, higher-velocitiesâStowâ for shipping and storageSpringFlex may additionally offer height adjustments for the handlebars and height/tilt adjustments for the seat. Ride positioning is simple and easy, due to the incorporation of advanced materials into a superior design that eliminates the usual sticking and dragging normally associated with fine-tuning these components. An example which shows three possible handlebar orientations in one image is shown inFIG. 33.FIG. 34shows an example of an orientation of handlebars. An example which shows three possible seat heights in one image is shown inFIG. 35.ControlIn an example, SpringComâ¢ is the bicycle system's user interface. Its handlebar-integrated, left and right side, three-button controls leverage the user's Device to:Activate and deactivate turn signal lightsTrigger the bicycle system's hornManually activate/deactivate the bicycle system's forward-facing projection lightAn example of handlebars in a bicycle system, including a smartphone holder which is holding a smartphone, is shown inFIG. 36.Moreover, SpringCom may provide users the ability to manually regulate pedaling cadence via its right side three-button control, thereby overriding the bicycle system's automatic CVT torque control feature.SpringCom may communicate with users through a synergistic combination of haptic feedback and Device-displayed notices. Vibration motors embedded within the bicycle system's handlebar grips may provide haptic feedback. Haptics instill confidence by ensuring that SpringCom notices are not inadvertently missed.SpringCom notices may appear in response to input from SpringSmart, SpringApp, and MfC-compliant third party applications. Notices may be specifically designed to be clearly visible in a user's peripheral vision and to transfer maximum information with minimal distraction.FIG. 37ashows an example of a left handlebar in a bicycle system.FIG. 37bshows an example of a right handlebar in a bicycle system. An example of handlebars in a bicycle system, including a smartphone holder which is holding a smartphone (not shown), wherein it is indicated schematically that the handlebars are providing haptic feedback, is shown inFIG. 38. An example of a notice displayed by an App running on a smartphone which is docked to a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 39.NavigationIn an example, SpringApp's âFindâ feature offers an instructive example of how SpringCom combines haptics and notices to communicate with users. âFindâ may obtain location and turn-by-turn navigation data from smartphone Maps and/or from itself or from another smartphone App, or from Maps or services accessible from a smartphone, and/or from other third party providers. âFindâ may then utilize SpringCom's innovative system to deliver intuitive, cycling-centric TBTN instructions to a user using some or all of the following:Notice message arrows communicate direction of upcoming turn.Notice message colors communicate pre-turn information:Blue: Displayable only while the bicycle system is static and provides pre-trip information (e.g., âproceed to intersection of X and Y Street to beginâ).Green: Displayable while the bicycle system is in motion and indicates user has progressed halfway or less to next turn.Amber: Displayable while the bicycle system is in motion and indicates user has progressed halfway or more to next turn.Red: Displayable while the bicycle system is in motion and indicates that user is to take next turn.Direction of an upcoming turn and change in notice lighting color state are indicated by haptic vibration in the grip corresponding to direction of turn.SpringApp's Find FeatureSpringCom enables users to obtain the information they need without ever having to shift primary focus from the road.A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, even when the smartphone is not docked to the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 40a. A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, when the smartphone is docked to the bicycle system, and routing information is being provided. An example is shown inFIG. 40b. A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, when the smartphone is docked to the bicycle system, even when routing information is not being provided. On such a map screen, a selectable touch screen icon may provided, which when selected leads to the provision of routing information to a predefined destination, eg. a predefined Home destination. An example is shown inFIG. 40c.When a destination is selected on the smartphone that is docked to a bicycle system, and a route is requested, a route is calculated to the selected destination. Screen output may include a blue background colour. An example is shown inFIG. 41a. After a route has been calculated, navigation may be started.

This means many bicycle system users will not have been on a bike for years, so safety's importance increases. The bicycle system and its accompanying software meet this challenge and, in so doing, set a new standard for urban biking. Safety influences every aspect of the bicycle system and impacts even the smallest details. Though not always readily apparent, safety's importance is borne out by a host of meticulously considered elements, several examples of which follow.Warnings & RestrictionsExamples of the bicycle system's âbaked inâ approach to safety include:SpringApp's on-screen warnings, including:âRide Safe Warningâ, which is displayed each time a Device is SpringPortedâFrost Warningâ, which is displayed upon ambient temperatures dropping to 37Â° F.SpringApp's ability to leverage SpringSense data to âknowâ whether âits bicycle systemâ is on the go and then restrict in-motion feature access to those specifically designated for use while cycling.The App may display a warning screen, asking the user to travel safely on the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 20b. The App may display a frost alert. An example is shown inFIG. 22a.SpringBeepâ¢The bicycle system's SpringBeep is a battery-powered, frame-integrated speaker providing audible notice-of-presence (âNOPâ) to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians in proximity. SpringBeep also enables SpringNannyâ¢, the bicycle system's SpringPorted-Device monitoring system, as well as the bicycle system's SpringGuardâ¢ theft alarm.A schematic example of a frame-integrated speaker providing audible notice-of-presence is shown inFIG. 42.SpringBriteâ¢Lighting is a crucial safety component. In an example, the bicycle system delivers with SpringBrite its comprehensive lighting system. SpringBrite's frame-integrated projection element may provide white, high-intensity path lighting and may be auto-activated by SpringSmart when ambient light conditions fall below pre-set levels. An example of a frame-integrated projection element providing high-intensity path lighting is shown inFIG. 43.In an example, SpringBrite's NOP elements are high-intensity, constant-state lights integrated into the bicycle system's front and rear hubs (white and red, respectively) and the rear of its saddle (red) to provide NOP to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians in proximity. NOP lights may be auto-activated upon SpringPorting a Device and are protected by polycarbonate lenses engineered to resist impact and maximize visibility.A front hub may include a first light on a left side of the hub and a second light on a right side of the hub. An example is shown inFIG. 44. A saddle may include a light on a rear of the saddle. An example is shown inFIG. 45. A rear hub may include a first light on a left side of the hub and a second light on a right side of the hub. An example is shown inFIG. 46.In an example, SpringBrite's indication lights (âIndicatorsâ) enable users to signal to others of impending actions. High intensity, handlebar-integrated, amber Indicators may provide flashing left/right turn signals to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. Turn Indicators are controlled via the bicycle system's left-side three-button switch.A handle bar may include an indicator on the front of the handlebar which when lit shines light in front of the bicycle system. A handle bar may include an indicator on a side of a handlebar which when lit shines light to the side of the bicycle system. An example of a lit forward facing indicator and a lit sideways facing indicator is shown inFIG. 47a. An example of an unlit forward facing indicator and an unlit sideways facing indicator is shown inFIG. 47b.SpringBrite's speed reduction Indicator may automatically increase the brightness of the bicycle system's saddle integrated red NOP light to signal a user's reduction in speed.An example of a bicycle system in which the front hub lights are lit, in which the rear hub lights are lit, and in which a saddle light, which is a speed reduction indicator, is lit, is shown inFIG. 48.HealthBiking is universally acknowledged as being part of a healthy lifestyle; however, âbikersâ are but a small portion of the overall population. By targeting the considerably larger LPACs segment, the bicycle system will bring biking's health benefits to a much broader audience.Carbon Monoxide AlertsSpringSmart may actively monitor ambient carbon monoxide (âCOâ) via SpringSense and provides alert notices of unhealthy levels via SpringApp. Examples of related screen output are shown inFIG. 23a,FIG. 23b,FIG. 23c, andFIG. 23d,Third Party DevelopersIn an example, SpringSense derived electrocardiography (ECG), temperature, humidity, and CO data is available to third party developers for use in creating a variety of applications that will enhance riding experience and support efforts to adopt healthier lifestyles.SecurityRoad and mountain bike enthusiasts often spend upwards of $30,000 on their bikes. City dwellers look for dependability at the lowest possible price. This disparity is primarily attributable to theft.When a ride is completed, road and mountain bikers store their precious mounts in secure locations. Yet, for urban cyclists, a ârideâ may occur 200+ times a year, and the vast majority will include a series of shorter âtripsâ, many of which leave urban bikes exposed to theft. Furthermore, the more expensive the bike, the more likely it is to be stolen or stripped for parts.SpringGuardâ¢In an example, the bicycle system's SpringGuardâ¢ system eliminates theft as an objection to premium pricing. Its formidable theft deterrence arsenal may employ a layered system which may include the following features:SpringLocâ¢Bolt lock integrated into the bicycle system's bottom bracketDeactivated when a user SpringPorts a Device, and activated when the Device is undocked.Upon activation, SpringLoc:Disables the bicycle system's crank axle and, consequently, immobilizes its pedalsEstablishes the bicycle system's geo-position, after which, if motion exceeds a threshold eg. ten feet, SpringGuard:Alerts user via SMS/SpringApp notificationOptionally, triggers SpringGuard's theft alarmAn example of an engaged locking system in which a lock has disabled a bicycle system's crank axle is shown inFIG. 49a. An example of a disengaged locking system in which a lock has been released from a bicycle system's crank axle is shown inFIG. 49b.SpringLincâ¢Frame-integrated, retractable âsmart cableâ used to secure the bicycle system to bike racks, light poles, and other street furnitureIf severed, SpringGuard:Detects SpringLoc state and activates if requiredAlerts user via SMS/SpringApp notificationTriggers theft alarmAn example of a retractable cable which has been used to secure a bicycle system to a bicycle stand is shown inFIG. 50.SpringApp's âFindâ FeatureProvides lost or stolen bicycle system location tracking, via SpringSmart's transceiver module, smartphone Maps, and other third party provider data.Enables users to remotely trigger SpringGuard's theft alarm.FIG. 24,FIG. 25,FIG. 26,FIG. 27aandFIG. 27bshow examples of screen output which relate to lost or stolen bicycle system location tracking.SpringNannyâ¢SpringPorted Device monitoringSounds a series of short horn blasts via SpringBeep to alert a user who fails to remove his/her Device within a pre-established period of time after engaging the bicycle system's kickstand.Industrial DesignIntegration and/or customization of the bicycle system high-value components deters thieves who specialize in stripping bikes, as components are both difficult to remove and will not readily fit models from other brands.SpringGuard's layered approach to theft deterrence is calculated to make the bicycle system the least desirable cycle amongst bike thieves. Successfully executing a bicycle system theft will involve a much higher level of risk than that associated with any other bicycle model. Additionally, if a bicycle system is stolen, the thief ends up with a bike that cannot be ridden; components that have little value; and markedly higher exposure to criminal prosecution due to âFindâ's tracking feature.MaintenanceMany of today's cyclists are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with performing routine maintenance and repairs on their bikes. They rely on third party bike shops to fulfill this function, often waiting until a component fails catastrophically to seek assistance, when performing maintenance in a more expeditious manner would have saved time and money.While some user interaction is still required on maintenance, repair, and replacement issues, in an example the bicycle system takes much of the stress of its upkeep out of users' hands by monitoring wear on essential components and providing notification if attention is required. Additionally, a user may contact SpringCycles for assistance via remote diagnosis, thus adding an additional layer of comfort that a user's bicycle system will be kept in top condition.StatusIn an example, SpringApp's âStatusâ feature is a user's primary source of maintenance-related information. âStatusâ may leverage SpringSmart's algorithmic analysis of SpringSense-captured data to predict wear experienced by a bicycle system's CVT, brakes, wheels, tires, SpringPort, and electrical components. âStatusâ may then utilize this predictive data to provide a user with detailed status reports on key components, along with maintenance recommendations for each. âStatusâ may also track maintenance, repairs and replacements performed and auto-notify users of required or scheduled maintenance via SpringCom's notice lights and SMS notifications. Other than in cases of emergency, maintenance notifications may be batched and sent when a user's Device is not SpringPorted. âStatusâ may additionally act as a repository for warranty eligibility reports generated by SpringSmart from SpringSense-captured data. Warranty reports accessed through SpringApp cover frame-stress levels experienced, distance traveled, and hours of usage. SpringApp's âStatusâ feature may also allow a user experiencing system issues to request remote diagnosis from the SpringCycles' bicycle system Assistance Program (âCAPâ). CAP personnel can then determine if and when components need to be serviced, replaced, or repaired.SpringApp's âStatusâ FeatureAn App running on a smartphone which is docked to the bicycle system may provide a status screen which shows maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system. A selectable touch screen icon may be provided which if selected by a user provides further maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system. A selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component may be provided which if selected by a user provides maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component. An example of a status screen which shows maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system is shown inFIG. 51. An example of a sample of a sequence of screen output provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component in which maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component are provided is shown inFIG. 52aand inFIG. 52b. A swipeable sequence of screen output may be provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component in which maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component are provided. Examples of screen output provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon, which if selected by a user provides further maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system, is shown inFIG. 53a,FIG. 53b,FIG. 53c, andFIG. 53d. A selectable touch screen icon may be provided to send a report to a central reporting server. An example is shown inFIG. 53d. A confirmation screen may be provided for a user to confirm that the user wants to send a report to a central reporting server. An example is shown inFIG. 53e.AccessoriesWhile the bicycle system is loaded with features, many users will want to either personalize their bicycle system or better adapt certain features to their specific needs by adding certain accessories. SpringCycles may support users through its SpringLoadedâ¢ licensing program.SpringLoadedâ¢The bicycle system's unique industrial design presents a robust platform for mounting a range of accessories. Third party developers committed to matching the bicycle system's elegance, functionality, and rigorous quality standards may receive a license to produce accessories carrying the SpringLoaded mark. SpringLoaded accessories may be available for purchase at launch.A platform for mounting accessories may be provided above a rear wheel of the bicycle system. The platform may be a platform which is elongate in the direction from the saddle to the rear of the bicycle system. The platform may include a recess for receiving an accessory, wherein the recess extends along the elongate platform. The platform may be in attachment with a saddle support. The platform may include a spur arranged to abut against a frame of the bicycle system, the spur providing support for the platform in a loaded configuration of the platform. An example is shown inFIG. 54. An example of a platform in an unloaded configuration is shown inFIG. 55a. An example of a platform in a loaded configuration is shown inFIG. 55b.PackagingâUnboxingâ can be a delightful bonding moment between user and product. The bicycle system's packaging, SpringBoxâ¢, is designed to provide that very experience.SpringBoxâ¢While sealed, SpringBox's premium materials, construction, and graphic design combine to powerfully signal that SpringBox contains something special. Users will also note that SpringBox is extremely easy to openâin an example, three turns with a medium-sized coin inserted into SpringBox's quick-release locks is all that is required. SpringBox may then open from the top and one side to display its contents.While the newly revealed bicycle system will understandably take center stage, users will, if only subconsciously, sense the care and attention to detail put into ensuring each bicycle system arrives in pristine, ready-to-ride condition. Users will note the precisely fitted bio-foam insets used to fully isolate and protect the bicycle system from even excessive mishandling during transport. They will also recognize that SpringBox is far more than mere packaging, that it is actually a valuable accessory intended to be used on an ongoing basis for storage and/or future transport needs. An example of a bicycle system's packaging in an open configuration is shown on the left hand side ofFIG. 56. An example of a set of five bicycle systems' packaging in a closed configuration is shown on the right hand side ofFIG. 56.Users will be relieved to find an absence of zip-ties, twist-ties, and the virtually indestructible plastic packing materials so common in consumer products. In fact, the same coin used to open SpringBox may release its internal fastenings, allowing the bicycle system to be removed with a gentle tug. Initial setup may then proceed in the following manner:Adjust handlebars from âStowâ (parallel to frame) to either the âSpeedâ or âComfortâ position (both perpendicular to frame)Adjust pedals from their vertical shipping position to a horizontal ride positionAdjust seat and handlebar heightLaunch SpringApp's âSynchâ feature and follow its step-by-step, initial smartphone Device/bicycle system pairing instructions.In an example, by delivering a fully assembled bicycle system (including nitrogen-filled tires and partially charged batteries), SpringBox ensures a user can enjoy their first ride within 30 minutes of beginning the unboxing process.RemarksHaving reached this stage, we hope you agree that the bicycle system is the bike consumers want. We have shown how the bicycle system makes a smartphone integral to its unprecedented feature-set and, consequently, to how consumers will see it complementing and enhancing their lives. We have also demonstrated how navigation, security, and ride quality can all become groundbreaking innovations in their own right.While innovation, artful design, and flawless integration all make us happy, we view them merely as footnotes to fantastic user experiences leading to healthier lifestyles. Our goal is simpleâpure delight each and every time a user SpringPorts a smartphone device and rides away.We look forward to providing the chance for you to take a ride of your own.Defined TermsAuthenticated smartphone (âDeviceâ), eg. aniPhone4 or 5, running iOS 6.x or later,Turn-by-turn navigation (âTBTNâ)Electrocardiography (âECGâ)Continuously variable transmission (âCVTâ)Carbon monoxide (âCOâ)Notice-of-presence (âNOPâ)In an example, SpringAppâ¢ is a feature for Connectivity: a smartphone application enablingSensor data and system alerts viewingFeatures executionâSynchâDevice pairing/unpairingâShareâGuest user sharingâFindâTBTNLost/stolen the bicycle system trackingRemote theft alarm activationâStatusâComponent status accessMaintenance recommendationsRemote assistanceIn an example, SpringApp'sâ¢ âFindâ Feature is a feature for Navigation, TBTN via SpringCom, in which the following may occur:Arrows communicate directionColors communicate pre-turn informationBlueDisplayable while the bicycle system is staticProvides pre-trip instructionsGreenDisplayable while the bicycle system is in motionIndicates user has progressed halfway or less to next turnAmberDisplayable while the bicycle system is in motionIndicates user has progressed halfway or more to next turnRedDisplayable while the bicycle system is in motionIndicates that user is to take next turnDirection and change in notice lighting color state indicated by haptic vibration in grip corresponding to direction of turnIn an example, SpringApp'sâ¢ âFindâ Feature is a feature for Safety: Warnings & Restrictions.

The briefs requisite blend of modernism with traditionalism, technology with craft, was met through a harmonious interdisciplinary approach formed by design and engineering. Working together required each group to consider all major bike nodes (seating, pedaling, transmission, handlebars, steering tube, etc.) from the other's perspective. Moreover, it ensured that the bicycle system embodied what came to be known as âTechnoCraftâ.Frame, Forks & FendersâLinear Fluencyâ informed the overall look and feel of the bicycle system's frame. The frame's strong linear lines âspillâ onto fenders, integrating them visually into the frame.Crank & KickstandThe crank is the central hub for a number of the bicycle system's design elements. It is suspended from the frame to create an iconic silhouette.

Field of the InventionThe field of the invention relates to bicycle systems, especially to bicycle systems adapted for use with smartphones, to smartphones configured for use with bicycle systems, and to methods and to computer software for use with such bicycle systems or smartphones, and to servers configured to communicate with such bicycle systems or smartphones.2. Technical BackgroundTechnological advancements have enhanced most modern day forms of transportation. For example, in the current smart-phone-centric society, operators and passengers of automobiles and airplanes have had their commute enriched with applications that enable users to tailor their experience. In contrast, the bicycle has remained comparatively primitive.3. Discussion of Related ArtThere have been developments in accessories that allow the usage of electronic devices, such as GPS systems or smart phones on a bicycle. However, these developments have typically been modular in nature and require that a user bolt on a GPS system to a bicycle or bolt on a docking system for a smart phone. There have even been developments to security systems for bicycles to allow tracking. The problem is that all of these accessories are separate from the bicycle and need to be added to a bicycle as a retro-fit. When these items are retro-fitted to a bike, durability and security become an issue. These accessories can be easily broken or stolen as they are simply bolted onto the bicycle. Further, each time an accessory is added, the bicycle becomes less aerodynamic and speed of the bicycle can be adversely affected. Here there are disclosed solutions to these problems by integrating accessories into the bicycle in a manner that they are all contained within the bicycle and it is not possible (or it is possible only with difficulty) for them to be broken off, stolen, or to interfere with the performance of the bicycle.Bicycles and smart phones exist independently in our society, and each is used in some manner to plan and complete trips from point A to point B. Here there are disclosed solutions which fully integrate the two. Additionally, the solutions offer a technology-based approach to protecting and maintaining the bicycle.The solutions disclosed herein relate to a bicycle's frame-embedded nervous system and provide the user with a fully interactive cycling experience. A handlebar integrated docking system allows the rider to customize and manage his trip âon the go.â Currently, a cyclist should turn off and stow his smartphone while operating a bicycle. Additionally, if a cyclist is unfamiliar with his location or gets lost in search of a destination, he should pull over and either check a map or ask for directions. Moreover, while bike locks currently do exist, they are independent, basic, detached devices. The solutions disclosed herein truly bring the bicycle into the 21st Century, and are designed with the tech-savvy, urban rider in mind.The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not intended to be, and are not to be construed as, statements or admissions of common general knowledge in the art. In particular, the above prior art discussion might not relate to what is commonly or well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists in the understanding of the inventive steps of the solutions disclosed herein of which the identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a bicycle system including a bicycle, the bicycle system including a processor integral to the bicycle, the bicycle system further including a battery integral to the bicycle, wherein the processor is powerable by the battery, the bicycle system including a smartphone holder configurable to receive a smartphone and to connect the smartphone to the processor, wherein in use the smartphone holder is attachable to, and detachable from, the smartphone.

A solution disclosed herein may also relate to a lock for locking an item, such as a bicycle, that is linked to software on an electronic device.A solution disclosed herein relates to a bicycle system comprising embedded electronics for controlling certain features and a handlebar integrated docking system for an electronic device, such as a smart phone, that acts as the rider-interface. The bicycle system may also contain a locking mechanism which is electronically-linked to said rider-interface.There is provided a bicycle system with integrated electronics.In one example, a bicycle system comprises: a bicycle frame further comprising an adjustable seat and an adjustable handlebar; an electronic device docking system integrated within said handlebar; front and rear hub caps capable of supporting an array of accessories integrated within said bicycle frame; electronics integrated within said bicycle frame wherein said electronics are powered by a battery and support features of the bicycle system; and a lock integrated into a bottom bracket of said bicycle frame.In one example, the bicycle frame is seamless, and contains adjustable handlebar orientation, seat height, and seat tilt. The position of said handlebar-integrated docking system is also adjustable. The seamless frame further comprises a front hub, rear hub, and a bottom bracket. Integrated into said rear hub is a continuously variable transmission (CVT) which features a carbon fiber belt and nanotech-coated sprocket and pulley profiles to provide step-less, automatic torque control, as well as optional manual gear shifting. One skilled in the art will recognize that the front and rear hubs may also be capable of supporting an array of custom accessories, such as an infant seat, cargo rack or other similar accessory.The bicycle system may further comprise a formidable theft deterrence and locking system. This locking system may provide unparalleled dual-level security. The first level is a bolt lock integrated into the bicycle's bottom bracket which is deactivated when the cyclist places an electronic device, such as a smart phone, into the handlebar-integrated docking system, and is activated when the device is undocked. The lock may contain a support bracket and a moveable, spring-loaded clamp. The second level of security is a frame-integrated, retractable cable. This cable can be used to secure the bicycle to bike racks, light poles, and other street furniture. Both the lock and the cable can detect theft attempts, trigger on-board electric alarms, and alert the bicycle system owner.The bicycle system may further comprise an integrated energy generation, storage, and charging system. The energy system consists of front and rear hubs and a front hub integrated kinetic generators, frame-embedded batteries, and an on-frame charging port. The primary power storage unit may be a lithium ion battery which, when progressively charged by said kinetic generators, ensures all-day, full-system performance. While the lithium battery is preferred, one skilled in the art will recognize that other battery types may also be possible. However, the bicycle system contains an on-frame DC charging port in the event the battery becomes discharged due to prolonged non-use.The bicycle system may further comprise a fully-integrated frame-embedded electronics system. The electronics system may comprise an application processor, transceiver module, wired or wireless technology, such as Bluetooth, Near field communication (NFC), etc., system memory, rider-accessible flash memory, user interface, and sensor processor which controls bicycle system features such as the CVT, smart battery charger, gyroscope, Electrocardiography (EKG) sensor, and a fully-integrated lighting system. It is anticipated that the electronics may be able to control any number of desired features and that the list of features is in no way limited by the above listing. The lighting system comprises white stem projection lights, side bar indicator lights, front and rear, dual-sided notice-of-presence lights, seat notice-of-presence lights, and right-sided CVT buttons. It is preferred that any number of lights be utilized on the bicycle frame to achieve desired results for a user. The lighting system and its accompanying lights provide high visibility and increased awareness to other road users which increases safety to the user and his/her surroundings.The application processor may control vibrating haptic feedback to the rider, the bicycle kickstand, cable lock, horn, locking mechanism, and the detection of the presence of the user's smart phone on the handlebar-mounted docking system. To further enhance the user experience, the bicycle may also be equipped with an advanced sensor array which provides a range of ambient data including, but not limited to, carbon monoxide levels, temperature readings, humidity, light and noise levels as well as physical data such as heading, velocity, acceleration, and orientation. When the bicycle system takes its own range of ambient data, the readings are more accurate than what a user may find when looking up data remotely.Customized, user-friendly control of the aforementioned features may be achieved via an application on the user's smart phone that may sync to and communicate with the bicycle system upon docking to the handlebar-integrated docking station. A user is also able to communicate with the bicycle system when the electronic device is not docked by using mobile communication networks. Features, such as mapping and turn-by-turn navigation, are then accessible to the rider while the bicycle system is in operation. All the while, the bicycle system may utilize haptics and provide audible notices to the user to ensure optimum safety.An integration point between the user and a solution disclosed herein is the handlebar-integrated smart phone docking station. The user is able to download and install an application on an electronic device to be identified by the bicycle system's recognition software when placed into the docking station after an initial registration and syncing process is completed. One skilled in the art will recognize that the electronic device is preferred to be a smart mobile phone or other similar electronic device so long as it is capable of sending or receiving information. When recognized as the owner's smart phone, the bicycle system-embedded software may launch and display a customizable âWelcome screenâ on the face of the smart phone. If a potential user attempts to place a non-registered device on the bicycle system, an âUnauthorized screenâ may pop-up on the device and a signal may be sent to the registered owner's registered device warning of a potential theft. Additionally, the registered owner can program the bicycle system's horn and lights to activate in an alarming manner when a non-registered device is docked. Similarly, the registered owner can program the bicycle system's horn and lights to activate if the kickstand is retracted or if the cable lock is cut without the registered device on the docking station.If a registered device is recognized by the embedded software via the docking station, the user may be prompted to Sign In. After a recognized ID and password are entered, the bicycle system's navigation screen may appear on the docked device. The first time a recognized device is docked on a calendar day, the âWarning Screenâ appears, providing common sense cycling safety advice. After the âWarning Screenâ is manually dismissed by the user, the âBike Stoppedâ screen is displayed and the bicycle system is ready for use. Upon movement, the âBike Stoppedâ screen is replaced by the âBike in Motionâ screen. This solution's motion-recognition software detects motion and hides/shows elements differently when riding versus when stopped. For example, detailed maps are displayed when the bike is stopped, while bike speed is displayed while the bike is in motion. Moreover, screen input is locked when bike motion is detected to ensure safe, non-distracted, riding.Another feature of the solution is the on-board navigation system which uses haptic feedback to relay directions. For example, from a stopped position, the user can program a desired destination into the docked device; in turn, the bicycle system's navigation system may calculate and show the route on the screen of the docked device. Once the user begins to move, the âBike in Motionâ screen may engage and display directional arrows to guide the cyclist to the entered destination. When turns are required, vibration motors embedded within the handlebar grips signal the correct direction to the cyclist, e.g. the left hand grip rumbles twice indicating that cyclist needs to take the next left hand turn. Routes can also be re-calculated in instances where a user cycles off course.In a second example, a solution disclosed herein relates to the lock for linking an electronic device to an item comprising the item to be locked or unlocked, an electronic device, and a locking mechanism wherein the locking mechanism is linked to the electronic device. In an example, the lock is integrated into the bicycle system's bottom bracket and electronically connected to the docking station via the bicycle system's embedded software. When a registered device is placed on the handlebar-integrated docking system, and is recognized by the bicycle system's embedded software, the lock is disengaged and the bicycle system's crank axle is enabled to allow movement. The lock is engaged when the registered device is removed from the docking station. When the registered device is removed from the docking station, an electronic signal is sent to the lock and the spring-loaded, movable clamp is lowered onto the crank axle, disabling the axle and immobilizing the pedals.In instances where the bicycle system is stolen or the lock is tampered or broken, the bicycle system is able to notify a user's electronic device by sending a message regarding the status of the bicycle system or lock. The bicycle system may then also be able to transmit its location to a user's electronic device which is a major theft deterrent.This and other examples will be more thoroughly realized with reference to the drawings and detailed description below.A bicycle system (1) may comprise a seamless frame (16), with a front hub (8), a rear hub (14), and a bottom bracket (10). The seat (2) and handlebar (6) may be adjustable to accommodate the individual user.The primary mechanism of accomplishing device to bike connectivity may be by placing an electronic device (5), in the handlebar-integrated docking system (4).The drivetrain's transmission (CVT) (21) may be integrated into the bicycle at the rear hub (14) and may utilize a carbon fiber belt (12) to deliver smoother, quieter operation than traditional chain systems. An example is shown inFIG. 1.A bicycle system (1) may feature an integrated lock that is activated and deactivated when the user places a smart phone, or similar device, on the docking station linked to the bicycle system (1). The lock may be connected to the bicycle system at crank axle (12a). An example is shown inFIGS. 2a, 2band2c.The lock (15) may be comprised of a support bracket (6z) and a spring-loaded, moveable clamp (11). The lock may attach to the bicycle system's crank axle (12a) at a locking point (2a) which is embedded within the bicycle system's bottom bracket (10). Springs (13a,13b) may provide a point of compression for the clamp (11) when it is either locked or unlocked.FIG. 2cdepicts an example of a lock in an engaged, locked state. The lock (15) may receive a lock signal from an electronic device (5) which causes the clamp (11) to move into position around the axle (12a). When the lock is engaged, the pedal cranks (4a,4b) are disabled and cannot be moved. This in turn causes the bicycle system movement to be disabled.FIG. 2bdepicts an example of a lock in a disengaged, unlocked state. To disengage, the lock (15) may receive an unlock signal from an electronic device (5) which causes the clamp (11) to move upward to release the axle (12a).In an example, a bicycle system has been designed to enhance the user experience. The main interaction between user and bicycle occurs at the handlebar. Integrated into the handlebar is the docking station (4) for the user's electronic device (5). The electronic device (5), provides on-screen control and feedback information to the user, and contains such features as a CVT indicator (7), for example, which indicates the current gearing of the bike. The handlebar further comprises right (6a) and left (6b) switches to control bicycle system features such as the right (8a) and left (8b) turn signals, the horn, the projection lights, the launch of the Bike App, or for switching the transmission from manual to automatic and vice versa. An example is shown inFIG. 3.There are provided Transmission Behavior and Handlebar Controls. CVT may be self-controlling with behavior inputs from the bike electronics. Handlebar switches may allow control of bike lighting, horn, transmission, and other functions. For navigation, an upcoming/current left turn indicator light (30a) may be provided. For navigation, an upcoming/current right turn indicator light (30b) may be provided. (âIndicator lightsâ are usually referred to as âturn signalsâ in US English). A Bike CVT Indicator (7) may be provided. Left hand switch (6b) may control a turn signal, a horn and a projection light. With the right switch, a single press may toggle a right turn signal on/off. With the right switch, a long press may toggle a projection light flashing function on/off. With a center switch, this may sound a horn as long as it is depressed. With a left switch, a single press may toggle a left turn signal on/off. With the left switch, a long press may toggle a projection light on/off. Haptic feedback in left hand grip (32a) may be provided for navigation turn indicators. Haptic feedback in right hand grip (32b) may be provided for navigation turn indicators. Haptic feedback may be provided on a corresponding side of a handlebar trigger as a turn approaches. Right hand switch (6a) may control transmission and bike app controls. A left switch may set transmission one selection softer (automatic) or down one gear (manual). A center switch, with a single press may switch between Automatic Transmission and Manual Transmission. A center switch, with a long press may launch a Bike app if not currently running a Bike app. A right switch may set transmission one selection harder (Automatic) or up one gear (Manual). Modes may be kept in App memory (bike should remember last setting). Switching between Automatic and Manual should aim to have a seamless ride style. App should launch in Automatic mode. Docking the bike may begin a registration check. After a smartphone is confirmed as valid, an ambient light sensor may turn on a projection light and NOP lights. An example is shown inFIG. 3.Turning toFIG. 4, an example of an electrical system for the bicycle system's nervous system is depicted. AndFIG. 5depicts an example of a corresponding power architecture.FIGS. 4 and 5set forth an example of a manner and order in which the various components of the embedded software system interact in order for the user's commands to result in various programmed outputs.In an example electrical system for a bicycle system, an application processor is in connection with GSM, GPS and Bluetooth+enhanced data rate (BT+EDR) antennae. The application processor is in connection with a USB Connector, system memory (including double data rate (DDR) and flash memory), system storage (including micro Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC)), a loud speaker, debug connectors (including RS-232, Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) and micro USB). The application processor is in connection with a power regeneration and management function. The application processor is connected to a sensor microcontroller (MCU) via universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver/transmitter (USART) and General-purpose input/output (GPIO) interfaces. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with debug connectors (including UART0 and JTAG). The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with a smartphone (eg. iphone) dock via a USB connection. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection via connections (eg. analogue to digital converters (ADC)) to an ambient light sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor and to a CO sensor. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with an accelerometer and magnetometer, a pressure/altimeter, a CVT, a smartphone authentication, a gyroscope, and to a biometric sensor. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with stem projection lights, side bar indicator lights, front left and front right NOP lights, rear left and rear right NOP lights, a saddle mount NOP light, CVT buttons, haptic feedback, a kickstand, a cable lock, lighting buttons, a piezo buzzer, and a crank lock. An example electrical system for a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 4.In an example of a power architecture of a bicycle system, output from a dynamo of the bicycle system is passed through a bridge rectifier and a bulk capacitor to a main system smart battery charger which provides for example asingle output12V charging voltage. Alternatively, power from an external AC to DC power supply, 19V to 24 V, 4 A, may be provided to the system battery charger when the bicycle system is stationary and locked. Output from the system battery charger is fed to the main system battery, eg. at 12V or at 16.8V. Main system battery output may be used at 7.4V for charging a secondary battery, which may store 2.2 Ahrs charge at 7.4V for supplying 5V, 1.5 A (2 A maximum) for a USB charging port via a USB current limiter. Main system battery output may provide output at 5V, 2.5 A (regulator) for powering a CO sensor, a LED lighting supply, or a crank lock stepper motor driver. Main system battery output may be used at 3.3V, 350 mA (regulator) for powering a sensor MCU, or sensors. Main system battery output may be used at 12V, 1 A for powering an automatic transmission. Main system battery output may be used at 3.8V, 2 A (regulator) to power a GSM/GPS unit, a Bluetooth interface and an application processor.

Users registered at the server may link their account to a smartphone and to a bicycle system.A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, but which is not linked to a bicycle system, may download an app from the server which is an app for use with a bicycle system. A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, but which is not linked to a bicycle system may download an app from the server which is an app for use with a bicycle system and run the app on their smartphone. Running such an app may provide a splash screen, followed by a settings screen. On the smartphone, the app may not display a Home screen or a Status screen, because the user does not have a bicycle system linked to their account. The server may provide a screen to a user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, but which is not linked to a bicycle system, which lists Apps available for use with a bicycle system; this may showcase the Apps available for use with a bicycle system. A related example is shown inFIG. 6a(a).A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, and which is not linked to a bicycle system, may download an app from the server which is an app for use with a bicycle system. A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, and which is not linked to a bicycle system may download an app from the server which is an app for use with a bicycle system and run the app on their smartphone while it is docked with a bicycle system. Running such an app may provide a Welcome Screen. The Welcome Screen may provide the options to Sign In or to Join. A Sign In option may allow a user to sign in to their registered account at the server, such as by providing a username and a password, or by providing a phone number and a password. After signing in, a user may be provided with a registered user App settings screen. A Join option may allow a user to confirm that their particular bicycle system with its own unique ID is the particular bicycle system which should be linked with the account registered at the server. A user may Join by providing their email, phone, password, and confirm the password. The App may then provide the user with a registered user App settings screen. A related example is shown inFIG. 6a(b).A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, and which is linked to a bicycle system, may download an app from the server which is an app for use with a bicycle system. A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, and which is linked to a bicycle system may download an app from the server which is an app for use with a bicycle system and run the app on their smartphone. A user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, and which is linked to a bicycle system, may view bicycle system data, or access or unlock a docked bicycle system, while in connection with the server. When a user with an account which is linked to a smartphone, and which is linked to a bicycle system, runs the app on their smartphone, in a first stage, the app may check that the user is a registered user. In a second stage, the app may check on the type of registered user, such as a guest with bicycle system privileges, or as a fully registered owner. If a user is a guest with bicycle system privileges, the App may check if the smartphone is docked in a bicycle system. If it is not docked, a Home screen may be provided on which it is noted that the phone is not docked with a bicycle system. If it is docked, a warning screen may be displayed which warns that the user to travel safely. If a user is a fully registered owner of a bicycle system, then the App may check if the smartphone is docked in a bicycle system. If it is not docked, a Home screen may be provided on which it is noted that the phone is not docked with a bicycle system. If it is docked, the App may proceed to display information such as that the phone is docked with the bicycle system, or the current speed of the bicycle system.

In an example, there is provided a bicycle system which is the world's first bicycle system specifically created to extend and enhance the smartphone lifestyle. It may seamlessly integrate a smartphone with an elegant, innovative design to deliver a peerless balance of form and function-one we strongly believe will resonate with existing and future smartphone consumers alike. Examples are shown inFIGS. 7 to 16.In an example, the bicycle system begins with general consumer expectations of what a bicycle âisâ and then decidedly exceeds those expectations through its calculated fusion of performance, technology, ergonomics, dependability, safety, and aesthetics. In an example, the bicycle system propels cycling's evolution from its sporting/utilitarian roots to the vanguard of urban mobility. It signals âdiscreetly premiumâ and denotes âprofessional-gradeâ and âprecision instrumentâ-all while providing a ride unmatched for style, comfort, safety, and security.To deliver on this vision, we developed an example key-feature set specifically devised to ensure the project maintained its consumer-driven focus. Here we walk you through each of these key features, providing detailed insight into the deliberate and thorough nature of each feature's development and its contribution to the whole. We hope you find the following both informative and enjoyable.FeaturesIn an example, the bicycle system is a sophisticated, smartphone-enhanced urban bicycle. In an example, the bicycle system's sophistication derives from combining a smartphone with a host of features specifically devised to deliver an unprecedented user experience.ConnectivityIn an example, the bicycle system seamlessly connects with any authenticated smartphone eg. aniPhoneâ¢4 or 5 device running iOS 6.x or a later version, in a number of innovative ways.SpringPortâ¢In an example, SpringPortâthe bicycle system's primary mechanism of accomplishing Device-to-bike connectivityâis an elegant, handlebar-integrated docking station. It envelops âSpringPortedâ Devices within the IP65-rated, moisture, dust, and vibration free environment created by a machined aluminum body with LexanÂ® optical grade, touch-compliant cover and silicone seals. (The IP Code, International Protection Marking, IEC standard 60529, sometimes interpreted as Ingress Protection Marking, classifies and rates the degree of protection provided against the intrusion (including body parts such as hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. It is published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)).In an example, the bicycle system ships with interchangeable trays (eg. polycarbonate trays) that allow users to easily adapt SpringPort for use with current Device models. Moreover, in an example, tray designs are readily updatable to maintain compatibility with future smartphone device form factors. In an example, âSpringPortingâ a smartphone Device is effortless, and once completed, prompts a series of auto-executed tasks, examples of which include:Discovering the Device's unique identifying code.Connecting the Device to the bicycle system's ânervous systemâ.Deactivating the bicycle system's theft deterrence system.Launching the bicycle system's companion smartphone application.Determining the Device's battery state and initiating charging if required.FIG. 17andFIG. 18show an example of a handlebar-integrated docking station receiving a smartphone for docking with a bicycle system.SpringSmartâ¢In an example, once âSpringPortedâ, a Device gains access to SpringSmart, the bicycle system's frame-embedded nervous system. SpringSmart elements may include:Processor (e.g. ARM CPU running MFi authentication)Transceiver module (eg. including BTLE, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, GPS, and HSPA+)Powered, multiband antennaMicro-SDHC system memoryRider-accessible flash memorySpringSmart may also incorporate SpringSenseâ¢, an advanced sensor array providing a range of ambient data, including e.g. carbon monoxide, temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels, as well as physical data, such as heading, velocity, acceleration, and orientation.In an example, the bicycle system achieves an ultra-low power budget due, primarily, to SpringSmart's robust systems management capabilities. SpringSmart safeguards its sensors, allowing application access only to the extent needed, thus permitting the balance to remain dormant. In an example, SpringSmart also powers its antennas only to the precise degree required by active applications. An example is shown inFIG. 19, which shows schematically that an electronics system architecture ofFIG. 4forms an integral part of a bicycle system.SpringAppâ¢In an example, SpringApp is the bicycle system's companion smartphone application. Following download, in an example, its Sync feature allows new users to couple a specific Device to a specific bicycle system. After syncing, users gain access to the full SpringApp feature set, which may include:SyncDevice pairing to additional bikes/unpairing from a specific bike.ShareCustomizable, eco-friendly bicycle system sharing with guest users, enabling a primary user to retain admin level control over security features while managing the type of access guest users are granted.FindCycling-centric, turn-by-turn navigation (âTBTNâ).Lost/stolen bicycle system tracking.Remote theft alarm activation.StatusAccess to data concerning the state of key components and recommendations to users concerning the maintenance of each request for remote assistance with bicycle system systems issues.Examples of Bicycle System SpringApp FeaturesWhen an App for a bicycle system starts to run on a smartphone docked with the bicycle system, the App may begin by displaying a splash screen. An example is shown inFIG. 20a. The App may display a warning screen, asking the user to travel safely on the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 20b. A Home Screen may be displayed if the bicycle system is stationary. An example is shown inFIG. 20c. A different Home Screen may be displayed if the bicycle system is in motion. An example is shown inFIG. 20d. A Home Screen may display one or more of a speedometer, calories calculated to have been burned by a user of the bicycle system, a ride timer, a CO meter reading, an altimeter reading and a Tab bar. An example is shown inFIG. 21. The App may display a frost alert. An example is shown inFIG. 22a. The App may display a frost warning, which may be displayed until frost conditions have cleared. An example is shown inFIG. 22b. The App may display a CO Warning. An example is shown inFIG. 23a. The App may display a CO Alert. The CO Alert may have a coloured background eg. an orange background. An example is shown inFIG. 23b. The App may display a CO Timer which may indicate that a CO Warning has persisted beyond a predefined time interval. The CO Timer may have a coloured background eg. a red background. An example is shown inFIG. 23c. The App may display dual warnings eg. a CO Warning and a Frost Warning. An example is shown inFIG. 23d. The App may display an alert using a modified version of a smartphone icon associated with the App. An example is shown inFIG. 24. An SMS alert relating to the bicycle system may be provided to the user of a smartphone associated with the bicycle system. The SMS alert may identify the bicycle system and include some SMS message text. An example is shown inFIG. 25. An App Notification relating to the bicycle system may be provided to the user of a smartphone associated with the bicycle system. The App Notification may identify the bicycle system and include some text. An example is shown inFIG. 26. A Home Screen may provide Tab bar alerts. An example is shown inFIG. 27a. An App Find Screen may provide a notification list of notifications relating to the bicycle system with which the smartphone running the App is associated. An example is shown inFIG. 27b. A status screen may be provided by the App which lists maintenance-related notifications. An example is shown inFIG. 27c.Made for the Bicycle SystemThird party developers may be provided an SDK (software development kit) for designing bicycle system-ready applications in addition to SpringApp. A flourishing application market may enhance user experience and serve to further expand smartphones to new markets via an entirely unexpected path. Applications certified as âMade for âbicycle system Cââ (or, âMfCâ), may be published on the bicycle system's âApplication Marketplaceâ site and on SpringApp, with summaries and reviews, and the ability for users to download applications directly from the two locations. Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system may be provided. Such Apps may be searchable as a category of Apps by a user using the smartphone. A list of such apps may be provided in response to a search of the category of Apps using the smartphone.FIG. 28(left hand side) shows an example of a list of Apps that has been generated on a smartphone in response to a search of a category of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system.FIG. 28further shows an example of screen output (right hand side) from an App which is first in a list (left hand side) of Apps that has been generated on a smartphone in response to a search of a category of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system. Advertisements for Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system may be provided in a list of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system.PowerIn an example, the bicycle system possesses not only the unique capacity to power its electrical systems, but also the ability to simultaneously charge a SpringPorted Device. Moreover, in the unlikely event a bicycle system has not been ridden in a while, a user can take comfort in the fact that a bicycle system's on-board power generation capabilities may be supplemented with an included AC/DC power charger and on-frame DC charge point.SpringSparcâ¢In an example, SpringSparc is a bicycle system's ingenious energy generation, storage, and charging system. It includes front and rear hub-integrated kinetic generators, frame-embedded batteries, and an on-frame charging port.In an example, SpringSparc's primary power storage unit is a 50 W lithium ion battery. A fully charged primary battery may power the bicycle system for six hours without interim charging. When progressively charged via SpringSparc's kinetic generators, the primary battery may ensure all-day, full-system performance. However, should the primary unit become completely discharged due to prolonged storage, in an example it may be brought rapidly to functional levels via SpringSparc's on-frame DC charging point and supplied, country-specific, AC/DC12V/90 W charger.In an example of a power management system of a bicycle system, output from a dynamo of the bicycle system is passed through a bridge rectifier and a bulk capacitor to a system battery charger which provides for example asingle output12V charging voltage. Alternatively, power from an external AC to DC power supply, 19V to 24 V, DC, 4 A, may be provided to the system battery charger when the bicycle system is stationary and locked. Output from the system battery charger is fed to the main system battery, at 12V or at 16.8V. Main system battery output may be used at 5V, 1.5 A (regulator) for smartphone charging, or for power output to a USB connector, or to a lighting connector. Main system battery output may be used at 5V, 1.5 A (regulator) for powering a CO sensor, a LED lighting supply, a speaker or a crank lock. Main system battery output may be used at 3.3V, 400 mA (regulator) for powering a sensor MCU, sensors, LED drivers, or a Hall Effect sensor. Main system battery output may be used at 18V-20V, 500 mA (regulator) for powering an automatic transmission. Main system battery output may be used to power a GSM/GPS battery charger (dual output 3.7V charging voltage); such output may also power an application processor. An example of a power management system of a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 30.A bicycle system may include a power management system.FIG. 29shows a schematic example of a bicycle system which includes an example of a power management system of a bicycle system, as shown inFIG. 30.In an example, SpringSparc's secondary battery is a 5 W unit specifically designated to provide MFi-compliant power to SpringPorted Devices for both on-board use and charging purposes. In an example, in terms of order of charging, the primary battery is charged initially, followed by the secondary battery, which then powers/charges a SpringPorted Device. In an example, SpringSmart gives SpringSparc's 2 W tertiary battery extra attention by trickle charging and conditioning it to maintain optimal performance levels at all times. This is beneficial due to the battery's role in supporting lost/stolen bicycle system tracking provided by SpringApp's âFindâ feature, as successful location could take several days due to the variety and quantity of factors that can affect GSM and GPS signal transmission and reception.As previously mentioned, in an example, SpringSmart controls all SpringSense sensors and ensures low power consumption by activating/deactivating sensors as needed. Additionally SpringApp may display real-time battery state, charging progress, and time-to-depletion information, along with Device battery levels. An example of display on a smartphone by an App of a smartphone battery state and of a bicycle system battery state is shown inFIG. 31.PerformanceLuxury, premium, and aspirational consumers (âLPACsâ) have grown too sophisticated to tolerate the hollow promises proffered by âform over functionâ. Indeed, LPACs are well aware that design is not enough, and that âpretty is as pretty doesâ applies as readily to products as it does to people. Which is why, for each of the countless hours dedicated to developing the bicycle system's elegant form, an equal measure was devoted to its functionality. The bicycle system represents a new class of urban transport.DrivetrainIn an example, the bicycle system's SpringDriveâ¢ delivers ride quality and utility. In an example, SpringDrive comprises one, two or three of three key components:Rear hub-integrated continuously variable transmission (âCVTâ) providing step-less, automatic torque control, as well as optional manual âgear shiftâ cadence adjustment.Carbon fiber belt delivering smoother, quieter operation than traditional chain systems, while providing all of a chain's efficiency without the associated mess and maintenance.Custom designed and meticulously engineered sprocket and pulley profiles, finished with a nanotech coating specifically formulated to provide unparalleled durability in even the harshest environments.An example is shown inFIG. 32.AdjustabilitySpringFlexâ¢ is a mechanism offering three possible handlebar orientations:âComfortâ for rider-upright, low-to-mid velocitiesâSpeedâ for rider-forward, higher-velocitiesâStowâ for shipping and storageSpringFlex may additionally offer height adjustments for the handlebars and height/tilt adjustments for the seat. Ride positioning is simple and easy, due to the incorporation of advanced materials into a superior design that eliminates the usual sticking and dragging normally associated with fine-tuning these components. An example which shows three possible handlebar orientations in one image is shown inFIG. 33.FIG. 34shows an example of an orientation of handlebars. An example which shows three possible seat heights in one image is shown inFIG. 35.ControlIn an example, SpringComâ¢ is the bicycle system's user interface. Its handlebar-integrated, left and right side, three-button controls leverage the user's Device to:Activate and deactivate turn signal lightsTrigger the bicycle system's hornManually activate/deactivate the bicycle system's forward-facing projection lightAn example of handlebars in a bicycle system, including a smartphone holder which is holding a smartphone, is shown inFIG. 36.Moreover, SpringCom may provide users the ability to manually regulate pedaling cadence via its right side three-button control, thereby overriding the bicycle system's automatic CVT torque control feature.SpringCom may communicate with users through a synergistic combination of haptic feedback and Device-displayed notices. Vibration motors embedded within the bicycle system's handlebar grips may provide haptic feedback. Haptics instill confidence by ensuring that SpringCom notices are not inadvertently missed.SpringCom notices may appear in response to input from SpringSmart, SpringApp, and MfC-compliant third party applications. Notices may be specifically designed to be clearly visible in a user's peripheral vision and to transfer maximum information with minimal distraction.FIG. 37ashows an example of a left handlebar in a bicycle system.FIG. 37bshows an example of a right handlebar in a bicycle system. An example of handlebars in a bicycle system, including a smartphone holder which is holding a smartphone (not shown), wherein it is indicated schematically that the handlebars are providing haptic feedback, is shown inFIG. 38. An example of a notice displayed by an App running on a smartphone which is docked to a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 39.NavigationIn an example, SpringApp's âFindâ feature offers an instructive example of how SpringCom combines haptics and notices to communicate with users. âFindâ may obtain location and turn-by-turn navigation data from smartphone Maps and/or from itself or from another smartphone App, or from Maps or services accessible from a smartphone, and/or from other third party providers. âFindâ may then utilize SpringCom's innovative system to deliver intuitive, cycling-centric TBTN instructions to a user using some or all of the following:Notice message arrows communicate direction of upcoming turn.Notice message colors communicate pre-turn information:Blue: Displayable only while the bicycle system is static and provides pre-trip information (e.g., âproceed to intersection of X and Y Street to beginâ).Green: Displayable while the bicycle system is in motion and indicates user has progressed halfway or less to next turn.Amber: Displayable while the bicycle system is in motion and indicates user has progressed halfway or more to next turn.Red: Displayable while the bicycle system is in motion and indicates that user is to take next turn.Direction of an upcoming turn and change in notice lighting color state are indicated by haptic vibration in the grip corresponding to direction of turn.SpringApp's Find FeatureSpringCom enables users to obtain the information they need without ever having to shift primary focus from the road.A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, even when the smartphone is not docked to the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 40a. A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, when the smartphone is docked to the bicycle system, and routing information is being provided. An example is shown inFIG. 40b. A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, when the smartphone is docked to the bicycle system, even when routing information is not being provided. On such a map screen, a selectable touch screen icon may provided, which when selected leads to the provision of routing information to a predefined destination, eg. a predefined Home destination. An example is shown inFIG. 40c.When a destination is selected on the smartphone that is docked to a bicycle system, and a route is requested, a route is calculated to the selected destination. Screen output may include a blue background colour. An example is shown inFIG. 41a. After a route has been calculated, navigation may be started.

This means many bicycle system users will not have been on a bike for years, so safety's importance increases. The bicycle system and its accompanying software meet this challenge and, in so doing, set a new standard for urban biking. Safety influences every aspect of the bicycle system and impacts even the smallest details. Though not always readily apparent, safety's importance is borne out by a host of meticulously considered elements, several examples of which follow.Warnings & RestrictionsExamples of the bicycle system's âbaked inâ approach to safety include:SpringApp's on-screen warnings, including:âRide Safe Warningâ, which is displayed each time a Device is SpringPortedâFrost Warningâ, which is displayed upon ambient temperatures dropping to 37Â° F.SpringApp's ability to leverage SpringSense data to âknowâ whether âits bicycle systemâ is on the go and then restrict in-motion feature access to those specifically designated for use while cycling.The App may display a warning screen, asking the user to travel safely on the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 20b. The App may display a frost alert. An example is shown inFIG. 22a.SpringBeepâ¢The bicycle system's SpringBeep is a battery-powered, frame-integrated speaker providing audible notice-of-presence (âNOPâ) to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians in proximity. SpringBeep also enables SpringNannyâ¢, the bicycle system's SpringPorted-Device monitoring system, as well as the bicycle system's SpringGuardâ¢ theft alarm.A schematic example of a frame-integrated speaker providing audible notice-of-presence is shown inFIG. 42.SpringBriteâ¢Lighting is a crucial safety component. In an example, the bicycle system delivers with SpringBrite its comprehensive lighting system. SpringBrite's frame-integrated projection element may provide white, high-intensity path lighting and may be auto-activated by SpringSmart when ambient light conditions fall below pre-set levels. An example of a frame-integrated projection element providing high-intensity path lighting is shown inFIG. 43.In an example, SpringBrite's NOP elements are high-intensity, constant-state lights integrated into the bicycle system's front and rear hubs (white and red, respectively) and the rear of its saddle (red) to provide NOP to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians in proximity. NOP lights may be auto-activated upon SpringPorting a Device and are protected by polycarbonate lenses engineered to resist impact and maximize visibility.A front hub may include a first light on a left side of the hub and a second light on a right side of the hub. An example is shown inFIG. 44. A saddle may include a light on a rear of the saddle. An example is shown inFIG. 45. A rear hub may include a first light on a left side of the hub and a second light on a right side of the hub. An example is shown inFIG. 46.In an example, SpringBrite's indication lights (âIndicatorsâ) enable users to signal to others of impending actions. High intensity, handlebar-integrated, amber Indicators may provide flashing left/right turn signals to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. Turn Indicators are controlled via the bicycle system's left-side three-button switch.A handle bar may include an indicator on the front of the handlebar which when lit shines light in front of the bicycle system. A handle bar may include an indicator on a side of a handlebar which when lit shines light to the side of the bicycle system. An example of a lit forward facing indicator and a lit sideways facing indicator is shown inFIG. 47a. An example of an unlit forward facing indicator and an unlit sideways facing indicator is shown inFIG. 47b.SpringBrite's speed reduction Indicator may automatically increase the brightness of the bicycle system's saddle integrated red NOP light to signal a user's reduction in speed.An example of a bicycle system in which the front hub lights are lit, in which the rear hub lights are lit, and in which a saddle light, which is a speed reduction indicator, is lit, is shown inFIG. 48.HealthBiking is universally acknowledged as being part of a healthy lifestyle; however, âbikersâ are but a small portion of the overall population. By targeting the considerably larger LPACs segment, the bicycle system will bring biking's health benefits to a much broader audience.Carbon Monoxide AlertsSpringSmart may actively monitor ambient carbon monoxide (âCOâ) via SpringSense and provides alert notices of unhealthy levels via SpringApp. Examples of related screen output are shown inFIG. 23a,FIG. 23b,FIG. 23c, andFIG. 23d,Third Party DevelopersIn an example, SpringSense derived electrocardiography (ECG), temperature, humidity, and CO data is available to third party developers for use in creating a variety of applications that will enhance riding experience and support efforts to adopt healthier lifestyles.SecurityRoad and mountain bike enthusiasts often spend upwards of $30,000 on their bikes. City dwellers look for dependability at the lowest possible price. This disparity is primarily attributable to theft.When a ride is completed, road and mountain bikers store their precious mounts in secure locations. Yet, for urban cyclists, a ârideâ may occur 200+ times a year, and the vast majority will include a series of shorter âtripsâ, many of which leave urban bikes exposed to theft. Furthermore, the more expensive the bike, the more likely it is to be stolen or stripped for parts.SpringGuardâ¢In an example, the bicycle system's SpringGuardâ¢ system eliminates theft as an objection to premium pricing. Its formidable theft deterrence arsenal may employ a layered system which may include the following features:SpringLocâ¢Bolt lock integrated into the bicycle system's bottom bracketDeactivated when a user SpringPorts a Device, and activated when the Device is undocked.Upon activation, SpringLoc:Disables the bicycle system's crank axle and, consequently, immobilizes its pedalsEstablishes the bicycle system's geo-position, after which, if motion exceeds a threshold eg. ten feet, SpringGuard:Alerts user via SMS/SpringApp notificationOptionally, triggers SpringGuard's theft alarmAn example of an engaged locking system in which a lock has disabled a bicycle system's crank axle is shown inFIG. 49a. An example of a disengaged locking system in which a lock has been released from a bicycle system's crank axle is shown inFIG. 49b.SpringLincâ¢Frame-integrated, retractable âsmart cableâ used to secure the bicycle system to bike racks, light poles, and other street furnitureIf severed, SpringGuard:Detects SpringLoc state and activates if requiredAlerts user via SMS/SpringApp notificationTriggers theft alarmAn example of a retractable cable which has been used to secure a bicycle system to a bicycle stand is shown inFIG. 50.SpringApp's âFindâ FeatureProvides lost or stolen bicycle system location tracking, via SpringSmart's transceiver module, smartphone Maps, and other third party provider data.Enables users to remotely trigger SpringGuard's theft alarm.FIG. 24,FIG. 25,FIG. 26,FIG. 27aandFIG. 27bshow examples of screen output which relate to lost or stolen bicycle system location tracking.SpringNannyâ¢SpringPorted Device monitoringSounds a series of short horn blasts via SpringBeep to alert a user who fails to remove his/her Device within a pre-established period of time after engaging the bicycle system's kickstand.Industrial DesignIntegration and/or customization of the bicycle system high-value components deters thieves who specialize in stripping bikes, as components are both difficult to remove and will not readily fit models from other brands.SpringGuard's layered approach to theft deterrence is calculated to make the bicycle system the least desirable cycle amongst bike thieves. Successfully executing a bicycle system theft will involve a much higher level of risk than that associated with any other bicycle model. Additionally, if a bicycle system is stolen, the thief ends up with a bike that cannot be ridden; components that have little value; and markedly higher exposure to criminal prosecution due to âFindâ's tracking feature.MaintenanceMany of today's cyclists are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with performing routine maintenance and repairs on their bikes. They rely on third party bike shops to fulfill this function, often waiting until a component fails catastrophically to seek assistance, when performing maintenance in a more expeditious manner would have saved time and money.While some user interaction is still required on maintenance, repair, and replacement issues, in an example the bicycle system takes much of the stress of its upkeep out of users' hands by monitoring wear on essential components and providing notification if attention is required. Additionally, a user may contact SpringCycles for assistance via remote diagnosis, thus adding an additional layer of comfort that a user's bicycle system will be kept in top condition.StatusIn an example, SpringApp's âStatusâ feature is a user's primary source of maintenance-related information. âStatusâ may leverage SpringSmart's algorithmic analysis of SpringSense-captured data to predict wear experienced by a bicycle system's CVT, brakes, wheels, tires, SpringPort, and electrical components. âStatusâ may then utilize this predictive data to provide a user with detailed status reports on key components, along with maintenance recommendations for each. âStatusâ may also track maintenance, repairs and replacements performed and auto-notify users of required or scheduled maintenance via SpringCom's notice lights and SMS notifications. Other than in cases of emergency, maintenance notifications may be batched and sent when a user's Device is not SpringPorted. âStatusâ may additionally act as a repository for warranty eligibility reports generated by SpringSmart from SpringSense-captured data. Warranty reports accessed through SpringApp cover frame-stress levels experienced, distance traveled, and hours of usage. SpringApp's âStatusâ feature may also allow a user experiencing system issues to request remote diagnosis from the SpringCycles' bicycle system Assistance Program (âCAPâ). CAP personnel can then determine if and when components need to be serviced, replaced, or repaired.SpringApp's âStatusâ FeatureAn App running on a smartphone which is docked to the bicycle system may provide a status screen which shows maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system. A selectable touch screen icon may be provided which if selected by a user provides further maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system. A selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component may be provided which if selected by a user provides maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component. An example of a status screen which shows maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system is shown inFIG. 51. An example of a sample of a sequence of screen output provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component in which maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component are provided is shown inFIG. 52aand inFIG. 52b. A swipeable sequence of screen output may be provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component in which maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component are provided. Examples of screen output provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon, which if selected by a user provides further maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system, is shown inFIG. 53a,FIG. 53b,FIG. 53c, andFIG. 53d. A selectable touch screen icon may be provided to send a report to a central reporting server. An example is shown inFIG. 53d. A confirmation screen may be provided for a user to confirm that the user wants to send a report to a central reporting server. An example is shown inFIG. 53e.AccessoriesWhile the bicycle system is loaded with features, many users will want to either personalize their bicycle system or better adapt certain features to their specific needs by adding certain accessories. SpringCycles may support users through its SpringLoadedâ¢ licensing program.SpringLoadedâ¢The bicycle system's unique industrial design presents a robust platform for mounting a range of accessories. Third party developers committed to matching the bicycle system's elegance, functionality, and rigorous quality standards may receive a license to produce accessories carrying the SpringLoaded mark. SpringLoaded accessories may be available for purchase at launch.A platform for mounting accessories may be provided above a rear wheel of the bicycle system. The platform may be a platform which is elongate in the direction from the saddle to the rear of the bicycle system. The platform may include a recess for receiving an accessory, wherein the recess extends along the elongate platform. The platform may be in attachment with a saddle support. The platform may include a spur arranged to abut against a frame of the bicycle system, the spur providing support for the platform in a loaded configuration of the platform. An example is shown inFIG. 54. An example of a platform in an unloaded configuration is shown inFIG. 55a. An example of a platform in a loaded configuration is shown inFIG. 55b.PackagingâUnboxingâ can be a delightful bonding moment between user and product. The bicycle system's packaging, SpringBoxâ¢, is designed to provide that very experience.SpringBoxâ¢While sealed, SpringBox's premium materials, construction, and graphic design combine to powerfully signal that SpringBox contains something special. Users will also note that SpringBox is extremely easy to openâin an example, three turns with a medium-sized coin inserted into SpringBox's quick-release locks is all that is required. SpringBox may then open from the top and one side to display its contents.While the newly revealed bicycle system will understandably take center stage, users will, if only subconsciously, sense the care and attention to detail put into ensuring each bicycle system arrives in pristine, ready-to-ride condition. Users will note the precisely fitted bio-foam insets used to fully isolate and protect the bicycle system from even excessive mishandling during transport. They will also recognize that SpringBox is far more than mere packaging, that it is actually a valuable accessory intended to be used on an ongoing basis for storage and/or future transport needs. An example of a bicycle system's packaging in an open configuration is shown on the left hand side ofFIG. 56. An example of a set of five bicycle systems' packaging in a closed configuration is shown on the right hand side ofFIG. 56.Users will be relieved to find an absence of zip-ties, twist-ties, and the virtually indestructible plastic packing materials so common in consumer products. In fact, the same coin used to open SpringBox may release its internal fastenings, allowing the bicycle system to be removed with a gentle tug. Initial setup may then proceed in the following manner:Adjust handlebars from âStowâ (parallel to frame) to either the âSpeedâ or âComfortâ position (both perpendicular to frame)Adjust pedals from their vertical shipping position to a horizontal ride positionAdjust seat and handlebar heightLaunch SpringApp's âSynchâ feature and follow its step-by-step, initial smartphone Device/bicycle system pairing instructions.In an example, by delivering a fully assembled bicycle system (including nitrogen-filled tires and partially charged batteries), SpringBox ensures a user can enjoy their first ride within 30 minutes of beginning the unboxing process.RemarksHaving reached this stage, we hope you agree that the bicycle system is the bike consumers want.

The briefs requisite blend of modernism with traditionalism, technology with craft, was met through a harmonious interdisciplinary approach formed by design and engineering. Working together required each group to consider all major bike nodes (seating, pedaling, transmission, handlebars, steering tube, etc.) from the other's perspective. Moreover, it ensured that the bicycle system embodied what came to be known as âTechnoCraftâ.Frame, Forks & FendersâLinear Fluencyâ informed the overall look and feel of the bicycle system's frame. The frame's strong linear lines âspillâ onto fenders, integrating them visually into the frame.Crank & KickstandThe crank is the central hub for a number of the bicycle system's design elements. It is suspended from the frame to create an iconic silhouette. Careful consideration was also given to the type of kickstand to be used, and after extensive testing, a crank-stand was found to be the most effective from an engineering standpoint, while it also proved to be the most complementary with the bicycle system's frame design.SpringComHigh content absorption and low distraction were the touchstones for SpringCom's user/bike interface. Device placement, therefore, was key, as were adjustability, comfort, and user stimulus. Careful attention was given to control switch manipulation and finger articulation. User interaction with the bicycle system was carefully considered and included ideas such as a combination of haptic feedback and light-based notices. âNotification fatigueâ and distraction were also a concern, and various methods of stimuli to address, inform, and warn were considered.Saddle & Seat PostThe bicycle system's saddle design balances intelligence and style. Moreover, due to the saddle's role as a key user/bicycle system interface, ergonomic analysis was required to create a design that would deliver all-day comfort as well.The bicycle system's seat post design seamlessly integrates directly into the bicycle system's unique frame shape. This results in the seat post fitting the bicycle system exclusively and, consequently, making it less desirable to those thieves who specialize in stripping bikes of valuable components. The seat post also integrates a PTFE bearing material to reduce friction and wear, thus enhancing user experience by eliminating the aggravating sticking aspect of traditional systems.The bicycle system may include a Frame-integrated accelerometer/magnetometer/GPS/gyroscope sensor module capturing location, velocity (i.e. direction and rate of travel) and acceleration data.The bicycle system may include a Frame-integrated transceiver array, comprising General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), GPS, and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), and providing wireless connectivity.The bicycle system may include Bike configuration adjustability enabled by:1) Headset-integrated mechanism offering three handlebar positions:a) âComfortâ for upright, low-to-mid velocity riding.b) âSpeedâ for forward, higher-velocity ridingc) âStowâ for shipping/storage, with handlebar arranged parallel to top tube.2) Height adjustments on the handlebars and height/tilt adjustments on the seat.The bicycle system may include Frame-integrated, customerized antennas enabling transceiver array.The bicycle system may include a Quiet, durable, carbon fiber-based drive system providing efficiency of traditional chain system but without need for lubrication, adjustment, or other maintenance.

The field of the invention relates to bicycle systems, especially to bicycle systems adapted for use with smartphones, to smartphones configured for use with bicycle systems, and to methods and to computer software for use with such bicycle systems or smartphones, and to servers configured to communicate with such bicycle systems or smartphones.

Technological advancements have enhanced most modern day forms of transportation. For example, in the current smart-phone-centric society, operators and passengers of automobiles and airplanes have had their commute enriched with applications that enable users to tailor their experience. In contrast, the bicycle has remained comparatively primitive.

There have been developments in accessories that allow the usage of electronic devices, such as GPS systems or smart phones on a bicycle. However, these developments have typically been modular in nature and require that a user bolt on a GPS system to a bicycle or bolt on a docking system for a smart phone. There have even been developments to security systems for bicycles to allow tracking. The problem is that all of these accessories are separate from the bicycle and need to be added to a bicycle as a retro-fit. When these items are retro-fitted to a bike, durability and security become an issue. These accessories can be easily broken or stolen as they are simply bolted onto the bicycle. Further, each time an accessory is added, the bicycle becomes less aerodynamic and speed of the bicycle can be adversely affected. Here there are disclosed solutions to these problems by integrating accessories into the bicycle in a manner that they are all contained within the bicycle and it is not possible (or it is possible only with difficulty) for them to be broken off, stolen, or to interfere with the performance of the bicycle.

Bicycles and smart phones exist independently in our society, and each is used in some manner to plan and complete trips from point A to point B. Here there are disclosed solutions which fully integrate the two. Additionally, the solutions offer a technology-based approach to protecting and maintaining the bicycle.

The solutions disclosed herein relate to a bicycle's frame-embedded nervous system and provide the user with a fully interactive cycling experience. A handlebar integrated docking system allows the rider to customize and manage his trip âon the go.â Currently, a cyclist should turn off and stow his smartphone while operating a bicycle. Additionally, if a cyclist is unfamiliar with his location or gets lost in search of a destination, he should pull over and either check a map or ask for directions. Moreover, while bike locks currently do exist, they are independent, basic, detached devices. The solutions disclosed herein truly bring the bicycle into the 21st Century, and are designed with the tech-savvy, urban rider in mind.

The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not intended to be, and are not to be construed as, statements or admissions of common general knowledge in the art. In particular, the above prior art discussion might not relate to what is commonly or well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists in the understanding of the inventive steps of the solutions disclosed herein of which the identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.

In one example, a bicycle system comprises: a bicycle frame further comprising an adjustable seat and an adjustable handlebar; an electronic device docking system integrated within said handlebar; front and rear hub caps capable of supporting an array of accessories integrated within said bicycle frame; electronics integrated within said bicycle frame wherein said electronics are powered by a battery and support features of the bicycle system; and a lock integrated into a bottom bracket of said bicycle frame.

In one example, the bicycle frame is seamless, and contains adjustable handlebar orientation, seat height, and seat tilt. The position of said handlebar-integrated docking system is also adjustable. The seamless frame further comprises a front hub, rear hub, and a bottom bracket. Integrated into said rear hub is a continuously variable transmission (CVT) which features a carbon fiber belt and nanotech-coated sprocket and pulley profiles to provide step-less, automatic torque control, as well as optional manual gear shifting. One skilled in the art will recognize that the front and rear hubs may also be capable of supporting an array of custom accessories, such as an infant seat, cargo rack or other similar accessory.

The bicycle system may further comprise a formidable theft deterrence and locking system. This locking system may provide unparalleled dual-level security. The first level is a bolt lock integrated into the bicycle's bottom bracket which is deactivated when the cyclist places an electronic device, such as a smart phone, into the handlebar-integrated docking system, and is activated when the device is undocked. The lock may contain a support bracket and a moveable, spring-loaded clamp. The second level of security is a frame-integrated, retractable cable. This cable can be used to secure the bicycle to bike racks, light poles, and other street furniture. Both the lock and the cable can detect theft attempts, trigger on-board electric alarms, and alert the bicycle system owner.

The bicycle system may further comprise an integrated energy generation, storage, and charging system. The energy system consists of front and rear hubs and a front hub integrated kinetic generators, frame-embedded batteries, and an on-frame charging port. The primary power storage unit may be a lithium ion battery which, when progressively charged by said kinetic generators, ensures all-day, full-system performance. While the lithium battery is preferred, one skilled in the art will recognize that other battery types may also be possible. However, the bicycle system contains an on-frame DC charging port in the event the battery becomes discharged due to prolonged non-use.

The bicycle system may further comprise a fully-integrated frame-embedded electronics system. The electronics system may comprise an application processor, transceiver module, wired or wireless technology, such as Bluetooth, Near field communication (NFC), etc., system memory, rider-accessible flash memory, user interface, and sensor processor which controls bicycle system features such as the CVT, smart battery charger, gyroscope, Electrocardiography (EKG) sensor, and a fully-integrated lighting system. It is anticipated that the electronics may be able to control any number of desired features and that the list of features is in no way limited by the above listing. The lighting system comprises white stem projection lights, side bar indicator lights, front and rear, dual-sided notice-of-presence lights, seat notice-of-presence lights, and right-sided CVT buttons. It is preferred that any number of lights be utilized on the bicycle frame to achieve desired results for a user. The lighting system and its accompanying lights provide high visibility and increased awareness to other road users which increases safety to the user and his/her surroundings.

The application processor may control vibrating haptic feedback to the rider, the bicycle kickstand, cable lock, horn, locking mechanism, and the detection of the presence of the user's smart phone on the handlebar-mounted docking system. To further enhance the user experience, the bicycle may also be equipped with an advanced sensor array which provides a range of ambient data including, but not limited to, carbon monoxide levels, temperature readings, humidity, light and noise levels as well as physical data such as heading, velocity, acceleration, and orientation. When the bicycle system takes its own range of ambient data, the readings are more accurate than what a user may find when looking up data remotely.

Customized, user-friendly control of the aforementioned features may be achieved via an application on the user's smart phone that may sync to and communicate with the bicycle system upon docking to the handlebar-integrated docking station. A user is also able to communicate with the bicycle system when the electronic device is not docked by using mobile communication networks. Features, such as mapping and turn-by-turn navigation, are then accessible to the rider while the bicycle system is in operation. All the while, the bicycle system may utilize haptics and provide audible notices to the user to ensure optimum safety.

An integration point between the user and a solution disclosed herein is the handlebar-integrated smart phone docking station. The user is able to download and install an application on an electronic device to be identified by the bicycle system's recognition software when placed into the docking station after an initial registration and syncing process is completed. One skilled in the art will recognize that the electronic device is preferred to be a smart mobile phone or other similar electronic device so long as it is capable of sending or receiving information. When recognized as the owner's smart phone, the bicycle system-embedded software may launch and display a customizable âWelcome screenâ on the face of the smart phone. If a potential user attempts to place a non-registered device on the bicycle system, an âUnauthorized screenâ may pop-up on the device and a signal may be sent to the registered owner's registered device warning of a potential theft. Additionally, the registered owner can program the bicycle system's horn and lights to activate in an alarming manner when a non-registered device is docked. Similarly, the registered owner can program the bicycle system's horn and lights to activate if the kickstand is retracted or if the cable lock is cut without the registered device on the docking station.

If a registered device is recognized by the embedded software via the docking station, the user may be prompted to Sign In. After a recognized ID and password are entered, the bicycle system's navigation screen may appear on the docked device. The first time a recognized device is docked on a calendar day, the âWarning Screenâ appears, providing common sense cycling safety advice. After the âWarning Screenâ is manually dismissed by the user, the âBike Stoppedâ screen is displayed and the bicycle system is ready for use. Upon movement, the âBike Stoppedâ screen is replaced by the âBike in Motionâ screen. This solution's motion-recognition software detects motion and hides/shows elements differently when riding versus when stopped. For example, detailed maps are displayed when the bike is stopped, while bike speed is displayed while the bike is in motion. Moreover, screen input is locked when bike motion is detected to ensure safe, non-distracted, riding.

Another feature of the solution is the on-board navigation system which uses haptic feedback to relay directions. For example, from a stopped position, the user can program a desired destination into the docked device; in turn, the bicycle system's navigation system may calculate and show the route on the screen of the docked device. Once the user begins to move, the âBike in Motionâ screen may engage and display directional arrows to guide the cyclist to the entered destination. When turns are required, vibration motors embedded within the handlebar grips signal the correct direction to the cyclist, e.g. the left hand grip rumbles twice indicating that cyclist needs to take the next left hand turn. Routes can also be re-calculated in instances where a user cycles off course.

In a second example, a solution disclosed herein relates to the lock for linking an electronic device to an item comprising the item to be locked or unlocked, an electronic device, and a locking mechanism wherein the locking mechanism is linked to the electronic device. In an example, the lock is integrated into the bicycle system's bottom bracket and electronically connected to the docking station via the bicycle system's embedded software. When a registered device is placed on the handlebar-integrated docking system, and is recognized by the bicycle system's embedded software, the lock is disengaged and the bicycle system's crank axle is enabled to allow movement. The lock is engaged when the registered device is removed from the docking station. When the registered device is removed from the docking station, an electronic signal is sent to the lock and the spring-loaded, movable clamp is lowered onto the crank axle, disabling the axle and immobilizing the pedals.

In instances where the bicycle system is stolen or the lock is tampered or broken, the bicycle system is able to notify a user's electronic device by sending a message regarding the status of the bicycle system or lock. The bicycle system may then also be able to transmit its location to a user's electronic device which is a major theft deterrent.

This and other examples will be more thoroughly realized with reference to the drawings and detailed description below.

A bicycle system (1) may comprise a seamless frame (16), with a front hub (8), a rear hub (14), and a bottom bracket (10). The seat (2) and handlebar (6) may be adjustable to accommodate the individual user.

The primary mechanism of accomplishing device to bike connectivity may be by placing an electronic device (5), in the handlebar-integrated docking system (4).

The drivetrain's transmission (CVT) (21) may be integrated into the bicycle at the rear hub (14) and may utilize a carbon fiber belt (12) to deliver smoother, quieter operation than traditional chain systems. An example is shown inFIG. 1.

A bicycle system (1) may feature an integrated lock that is activated and deactivated when the user places a smart phone, or similar device, on the docking station linked to the bicycle system (1). The lock may be connected to the bicycle system at crank axle (12a). An example is shown inFIGS. 2a, 2band2c.

The lock (15) may be comprised of a support bracket (6z) and a spring-loaded, moveable clamp (11). The lock may attach to the bicycle system's crank axle (12a) at a locking point (2a) which is embedded within the bicycle system's bottom bracket (10). Springs (13a,13b) may provide a point of compression for the clamp (11) when it is either locked or unlocked.FIG. 2cdepicts an example of a lock in an engaged, locked state. The lock (15) may receive a lock signal from an electronic device (5) which causes the clamp (11) to move into position around the axle (12a). When the lock is engaged, the pedal cranks (4a,4b) are disabled and cannot be moved. This in turn causes the bicycle system movement to be disabled.FIG. 2bdepicts an example of a lock in a disengaged, unlocked state. To disengage, the lock (15) may receive an unlock signal from an electronic device (5) which causes the clamp (11) to move upward to release the axle (12a).

In an example, a bicycle system has been designed to enhance the user experience. The main interaction between user and bicycle occurs at the handlebar. Integrated into the handlebar is the docking station (4) for the user's electronic device (5). The electronic device (5), provides on-screen control and feedback information to the user, and contains such features as a CVT indicator (7), for example, which indicates the current gearing of the bike. The handlebar further comprises right (6a) and left (6b) switches to control bicycle system features such as the right (8a) and left (8b) turn signals, the horn, the projection lights, the launch of the Bike App, or for switching the transmission from manual to automatic and vice versa. An example is shown inFIG. 3.

There are provided Transmission Behavior and Handlebar Controls. CVT may be self-controlling with behavior inputs from the bike electronics. Handlebar switches may allow control of bike lighting, horn, transmission, and other functions. For navigation, an upcoming/current left turn indicator light (30a) may be provided. For navigation, an upcoming/current right turn indicator light (30b) may be provided. (âIndicator lightsâ are usually referred to as âturn signalsâ in US English). A Bike CVT Indicator (7) may be provided. Left hand switch (6b) may control a turn signal, a horn and a projection light. With the right switch, a single press may toggle a right turn signal on/off. With the right switch, a long press may toggle a projection light flashing function on/off. With a center switch, this may sound a horn as long as it is depressed. With a left switch, a single press may toggle a left turn signal on/off. With the left switch, a long press may toggle a projection light on/off. Haptic feedback in left hand grip (32a) may be provided for navigation turn indicators. Haptic feedback in right hand grip (32b) may be provided for navigation turn indicators. Haptic feedback may be provided on a corresponding side of a handlebar trigger as a turn approaches. Right hand switch (6a) may control transmission and bike app controls. A left switch may set transmission one selection softer (automatic) or down one gear (manual). A center switch, with a single press may switch between Automatic Transmission and Manual Transmission. A center switch, with a long press may launch a Bike app if not currently running a Bike app. A right switch may set transmission one selection harder (Automatic) or up one gear (Manual). Modes may be kept in App memory (bike should remember last setting). Switching between Automatic and Manual should aim to have a seamless ride style. App should launch in Automatic mode. Docking the bike may begin a registration check. After a smartphone is confirmed as valid, an ambient light sensor may turn on a projection light and NOP lights. An example is shown inFIG. 3.

Turning toFIG. 4, an example of an electrical system for the bicycle system's nervous system is depicted. AndFIG. 5depicts an example of a corresponding power architecture.FIGS. 4 and 5set forth an example of a manner and order in which the various components of the embedded software system interact in order for the user's commands to result in various programmed outputs.

In an example electrical system for a bicycle system, an application processor is in connection with GSM, GPS and Bluetooth+enhanced data rate (BT+EDR) antennae. The application processor is in connection with a USB Connector, system memory (including double data rate (DDR) and flash memory), system storage (including micro Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC)), a loud speaker, debug connectors (including RS-232, Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) and micro USB). The application processor is in connection with a power regeneration and management function. The application processor is connected to a sensor microcontroller (MCU) via universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver/transmitter (USART) and General-purpose input/output (GPIO) interfaces. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with debug connectors (including UART0 and JTAG). The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with a smartphone (eg. iphone) dock via a USB connection. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection via connections (eg. analogue to digital converters (ADC)) to an ambient light sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor and to a CO sensor. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with an accelerometer and magnetometer, a pressure/altimeter, a CVT, a smartphone authentication, a gyroscope, and to a biometric sensor. The sensor microcontroller (MCU) is in connection with stem projection lights, side bar indicator lights, front left and front right NOP lights, rear left and rear right NOP lights, a saddle mount NOP light, CVT buttons, haptic feedback, a kickstand, a cable lock, lighting buttons, a piezo buzzer, and a crank lock. An example electrical system for a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 4.

In an example of a power architecture of a bicycle system, output from a dynamo of the bicycle system is passed through a bridge rectifier and a bulk capacitor to a main system smart battery charger which provides for example asingle output12V charging voltage. Alternatively, power from an external AC to DC power supply, 19V to 24 V, 4 A, may be provided to the system battery charger when the bicycle system is stationary and locked. Output from the system battery charger is fed to the main system battery, eg. at 12V or at 16.8V. Main system battery output may be used at 7.4V for charging a secondary battery, which may store 2.2 Ahrs charge at 7.4V for supplying 5V, 1.5 A (2 A maximum) for a USB charging port via a USB current limiter. Main system battery output may provide output at 5V, 2.5 A (regulator) for powering a CO sensor, a LED lighting supply, or a crank lock stepper motor driver. Main system battery output may be used at 3.3V, 350 mA (regulator) for powering a sensor MCU, or sensors. Main system battery output may be used at 12V, 1 A for powering an automatic transmission. Main system battery output may be used at 3.8V, 2 A (regulator) to power a GSM/GPS unit, a Bluetooth interface and an application processor. An example of a power architecture of a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 5.

The disclosure ofFIGS. 7 to 14includes an ornamental design for a bicycle frame, including the wheels, kickstand, and docking station as shown.FIGS. 7 to 14provide an example of a bicycle system.

In an example, there is provided a bike consumers will instantly recognize as the one they've always wanted. In an example, there is provided a bicycle system which is the world's first bicycle system specifically created to extend and enhance the smartphone lifestyle. It may seamlessly integrate a smartphone with an elegant, innovative design to deliver a peerless balance of form and function-one we strongly believe will resonate with existing and future smartphone consumers alike. Examples are shown inFIGS. 7 to 16.

In an example, the bicycle system begins with general consumer expectations of what a bicycle âisâ and then decidedly exceeds those expectations through its calculated fusion of performance, technology, ergonomics, dependability, safety, and aesthetics. In an example, the bicycle system propels cycling's evolution from its sporting/utilitarian roots to the vanguard of urban mobility. It signals âdiscreetly premiumâ and denotes âprofessional-gradeâ and âprecision instrumentâ-all while providing a ride unmatched for style, comfort, safety, and security.

To deliver on this vision, we developed an example key-feature set specifically devised to ensure the project maintained its consumer-driven focus. Here we walk you through each of these key features, providing detailed insight into the deliberate and thorough nature of each feature's development and its contribution to the whole. We hope you find the following both informative and enjoyable.

Features

In an example, the bicycle system is a sophisticated, smartphone-enhanced urban bicycle. In an example, the bicycle system's sophistication derives from combining a smartphone with a host of features specifically devised to deliver an unprecedented user experience.

Connectivity

In an example, the bicycle system seamlessly connects with any authenticated smartphone eg. aniPhoneâ¢4 or 5 device running iOS 6.x or a later version, in a number of innovative ways.

SpringPortâ¢

In an example, SpringPortâthe bicycle system's primary mechanism of accomplishing Device-to-bike connectivityâis an elegant, handlebar-integrated docking station. It envelops âSpringPortedâ Devices within the IP65-rated, moisture, dust, and vibration free environment created by a machined aluminum body with LexanÂ® optical grade, touch-compliant cover and silicone seals. (The IP Code, International Protection Marking, IEC standard 60529, sometimes interpreted as Ingress Protection Marking, classifies and rates the degree of protection provided against the intrusion (including body parts such as hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. It is published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)).

In an example, the bicycle system ships with interchangeable trays (eg. polycarbonate trays) that allow users to easily adapt SpringPort for use with current Device models. Moreover, in an example, tray designs are readily updatable to maintain compatibility with future smartphone device form factors. In an example, âSpringPortingâ a smartphone Device is effortless, and once completed, prompts a series of auto-executed tasks, examples of which include:

FIG. 17andFIG. 18show an example of a handlebar-integrated docking station receiving a smartphone for docking with a bicycle system.

SpringSmartâ¢

In an example, once âSpringPortedâ, a Device gains access to SpringSmart, the bicycle system's frame-embedded nervous system. SpringSmart elements may include:

SpringSmart may also incorporate SpringSenseâ¢, an advanced sensor array providing a range of ambient data, including e.g. carbon monoxide, temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels, as well as physical data, such as heading, velocity, acceleration, and orientation.

In an example, the bicycle system achieves an ultra-low power budget due, primarily, to SpringSmart's robust systems management capabilities. SpringSmart safeguards its sensors, allowing application access only to the extent needed, thus permitting the balance to remain dormant. In an example, SpringSmart also powers its antennas only to the precise degree required by active applications. An example is shown inFIG. 19, which shows schematically that an electronics system architecture ofFIG. 4forms an integral part of a bicycle system.

SpringAppâ¢

In an example, SpringApp is the bicycle system's companion smartphone application. Following download, in an example, its Sync feature allows new users to couple a specific Device to a specific bicycle system. After syncing, users gain access to the full SpringApp feature set, which may include:

Examples of Bicycle System SpringApp Features

When an App for a bicycle system starts to run on a smartphone docked with the bicycle system, the App may begin by displaying a splash screen. An example is shown inFIG. 20a. The App may display a warning screen, asking the user to travel safely on the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 20b. A Home Screen may be displayed if the bicycle system is stationary. An example is shown inFIG. 20c. A different Home Screen may be displayed if the bicycle system is in motion. An example is shown inFIG. 20d. A Home Screen may display one or more of a speedometer, calories calculated to have been burned by a user of the bicycle system, a ride timer, a CO meter reading, an altimeter reading and a Tab bar. An example is shown inFIG. 21. The App may display a frost alert. An example is shown inFIG. 22a. The App may display a frost warning, which may be displayed until frost conditions have cleared. An example is shown inFIG. 22b. The App may display a CO Warning. An example is shown inFIG. 23a. The App may display a CO Alert. The CO Alert may have a coloured background eg. an orange background. An example is shown inFIG. 23b. The App may display a CO Timer which may indicate that a CO Warning has persisted beyond a predefined time interval. The CO Timer may have a coloured background eg. a red background. An example is shown inFIG. 23c. The App may display dual warnings eg. a CO Warning and a Frost Warning. An example is shown inFIG. 23d. The App may display an alert using a modified version of a smartphone icon associated with the App. An example is shown inFIG. 24. An SMS alert relating to the bicycle system may be provided to the user of a smartphone associated with the bicycle system. The SMS alert may identify the bicycle system and include some SMS message text. An example is shown inFIG. 25. An App Notification relating to the bicycle system may be provided to the user of a smartphone associated with the bicycle system. The App Notification may identify the bicycle system and include some text. An example is shown inFIG. 26. A Home Screen may provide Tab bar alerts. An example is shown inFIG. 27a. An App Find Screen may provide a notification list of notifications relating to the bicycle system with which the smartphone running the App is associated. An example is shown inFIG. 27b. A status screen may be provided by the App which lists maintenance-related notifications. An example is shown inFIG. 27c.

Made for the Bicycle System

Third party developers may be provided an SDK (software development kit) for designing bicycle system-ready applications in addition to SpringApp. A flourishing application market may enhance user experience and serve to further expand smartphones to new markets via an entirely unexpected path. Applications certified as âMade for âbicycle system Cââ (or, âMfCâ), may be published on the bicycle system's âApplication Marketplaceâ site and on SpringApp, with summaries and reviews, and the ability for users to download applications directly from the two locations. Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system may be provided. Such Apps may be searchable as a category of Apps by a user using the smartphone. A list of such apps may be provided in response to a search of the category of Apps using the smartphone.FIG. 28(left hand side) shows an example of a list of Apps that has been generated on a smartphone in response to a search of a category of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system.FIG. 28further shows an example of screen output (right hand side) from an App which is first in a list (left hand side) of Apps that has been generated on a smartphone in response to a search of a category of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system. Advertisements for Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system may be provided in a list of Apps for use with a smartphone and a bicycle system.

Power

In an example, the bicycle system possesses not only the unique capacity to power its electrical systems, but also the ability to simultaneously charge a SpringPorted Device. Moreover, in the unlikely event a bicycle system has not been ridden in a while, a user can take comfort in the fact that a bicycle system's on-board power generation capabilities may be supplemented with an included AC/DC power charger and on-frame DC charge point.

SpringSparcâ¢

In an example, SpringSparc is a bicycle system's ingenious energy generation, storage, and charging system. It includes front and rear hub-integrated kinetic generators, frame-embedded batteries, and an on-frame charging port.

In an example, SpringSparc's primary power storage unit is a 50 W lithium ion battery. A fully charged primary battery may power the bicycle system for six hours without interim charging. When progressively charged via SpringSparc's kinetic generators, the primary battery may ensure all-day, full-system performance. However, should the primary unit become completely discharged due to prolonged storage, in an example it may be brought rapidly to functional levels via SpringSparc's on-frame DC charging point and supplied, country-specific, AC/DC12V/90 W charger.

In an example of a power management system of a bicycle system, output from a dynamo of the bicycle system is passed through a bridge rectifier and a bulk capacitor to a system battery charger which provides for example asingle output12V charging voltage. Alternatively, power from an external AC to DC power supply, 19V to 24 V, DC, 4 A, may be provided to the system battery charger when the bicycle system is stationary and locked. Output from the system battery charger is fed to the main system battery, at 12V or at 16.8V. Main system battery output may be used at 5V, 1.5 A (regulator) for smartphone charging, or for power output to a USB connector, or to a lighting connector. Main system battery output may be used at 5V, 1.5 A (regulator) for powering a CO sensor, a LED lighting supply, a speaker or a crank lock. Main system battery output may be used at 3.3V, 400 mA (regulator) for powering a sensor MCU, sensors, LED drivers, or a Hall Effect sensor. Main system battery output may be used at 18V-20V, 500 mA (regulator) for powering an automatic transmission. Main system battery output may be used to power a GSM/GPS battery charger (dual output 3.7V charging voltage); such output may also power an application processor. An example of a power management system of a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 30.

A bicycle system may include a power management system.FIG. 29shows a schematic example of a bicycle system which includes an example of a power management system of a bicycle system, as shown inFIG. 30.

In an example, SpringSparc's secondary battery is a 5 W unit specifically designated to provide MFi-compliant power to SpringPorted Devices for both on-board use and charging purposes. In an example, in terms of order of charging, the primary battery is charged initially, followed by the secondary battery, which then powers/charges a SpringPorted Device. In an example, SpringSmart gives SpringSparc's 2 W tertiary battery extra attention by trickle charging and conditioning it to maintain optimal performance levels at all times. This is beneficial due to the battery's role in supporting lost/stolen bicycle system tracking provided by SpringApp's âFindâ feature, as successful location could take several days due to the variety and quantity of factors that can affect GSM and GPS signal transmission and reception.

As previously mentioned, in an example, SpringSmart controls all SpringSense sensors and ensures low power consumption by activating/deactivating sensors as needed. Additionally SpringApp may display real-time battery state, charging progress, and time-to-depletion information, along with Device battery levels. An example of display on a smartphone by an App of a smartphone battery state and of a bicycle system battery state is shown inFIG. 31.

Performance

Luxury, premium, and aspirational consumers (âLPACsâ) have grown too sophisticated to tolerate the hollow promises proffered by âform over functionâ. Indeed, LPACs are well aware that design is not enough, and that âpretty is as pretty doesâ applies as readily to products as it does to people. Which is why, for each of the countless hours dedicated to developing the bicycle system's elegant form, an equal measure was devoted to its functionality. The bicycle system represents a new class of urban transport.

Drivetrain

In an example, the bicycle system's SpringDriveâ¢ delivers ride quality and utility. In an example, SpringDrive comprises one, two or three of three key components:

An example is shown inFIG. 32.

Adjustability

SpringFlexâ¢ is a mechanism offering three possible handlebar orientations:

SpringFlex may additionally offer height adjustments for the handlebars and height/tilt adjustments for the seat. Ride positioning is simple and easy, due to the incorporation of advanced materials into a superior design that eliminates the usual sticking and dragging normally associated with fine-tuning these components. An example which shows three possible handlebar orientations in one image is shown inFIG. 33.FIG. 34shows an example of an orientation of handlebars. An example which shows three possible seat heights in one image is shown inFIG. 35.

Control

In an example, SpringComâ¢ is the bicycle system's user interface. Its handlebar-integrated, left and right side, three-button controls leverage the user's Device to:

An example of handlebars in a bicycle system, including a smartphone holder which is holding a smartphone, is shown inFIG. 36.

Moreover, SpringCom may provide users the ability to manually regulate pedaling cadence via its right side three-button control, thereby overriding the bicycle system's automatic CVT torque control feature.

SpringCom may communicate with users through a synergistic combination of haptic feedback and Device-displayed notices. Vibration motors embedded within the bicycle system's handlebar grips may provide haptic feedback. Haptics instill confidence by ensuring that SpringCom notices are not inadvertently missed.

SpringCom notices may appear in response to input from SpringSmart, SpringApp, and MfC-compliant third party applications. Notices may be specifically designed to be clearly visible in a user's peripheral vision and to transfer maximum information with minimal distraction.

FIG. 37ashows an example of a left handlebar in a bicycle system.FIG. 37bshows an example of a right handlebar in a bicycle system. An example of handlebars in a bicycle system, including a smartphone holder which is holding a smartphone (not shown), wherein it is indicated schematically that the handlebars are providing haptic feedback, is shown inFIG. 38. An example of a notice displayed by an App running on a smartphone which is docked to a bicycle system is shown inFIG. 39.

Navigation

In an example, SpringApp's âFindâ feature offers an instructive example of how SpringCom combines haptics and notices to communicate with users. âFindâ may obtain location and turn-by-turn navigation data from smartphone Maps and/or from itself or from another smartphone App, or from Maps or services accessible from a smartphone, and/or from other third party providers. âFindâ may then utilize SpringCom's innovative system to deliver intuitive, cycling-centric TBTN instructions to a user using some or all of the following:

SpringApp's Find Feature

SpringCom enables users to obtain the information they need without ever having to shift primary focus from the road.

A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, even when the smartphone is not docked to the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 40a. A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, when the smartphone is docked to the bicycle system, and routing information is being provided. An example is shown inFIG. 40b. A map screen may be provided on the smartphone which shows a bicycle system's current position, when the smartphone is docked to the bicycle system, even when routing information is not being provided. On such a map screen, a selectable touch screen icon may provided, which when selected leads to the provision of routing information to a predefined destination, eg. a predefined Home destination. An example is shown inFIG. 40c.

When a destination is selected on the smartphone that is docked to a bicycle system, and a route is requested, a route is calculated to the selected destination. Screen output may include a blue background colour. An example is shown inFIG. 41a. After a route has been calculated, navigation may be started. Screen output may include a changed (eg. red) background colour.

A strong haptic output, which is dual in the sense that haptic output is provided to the left handlebar and to the right handlebar, may be provided. An example is shown inFIG. 41k.

The sequence of Figures fromFIG. 41atoFIG. 41kprovide an example of a sequence of Figures which relate to an example of bicycle system route guidance output during route calculation and route guidance provision.

Safety

While the bicycle system will certainly satisfy traditional bike consumers, its true market is the exponentially larger LPACs segment. This means many bicycle system users will not have been on a bike for years, so safety's importance increases. The bicycle system and its accompanying software meet this challenge and, in so doing, set a new standard for urban biking. Safety influences every aspect of the bicycle system and impacts even the smallest details. Though not always readily apparent, safety's importance is borne out by a host of meticulously considered elements, several examples of which follow.

Warnings & Restrictions

Examples of the bicycle system's âbaked inâ approach to safety include:

The App may display a warning screen, asking the user to travel safely on the bicycle system. An example is shown inFIG. 20b. The App may display a frost alert. An example is shown inFIG. 22a.

SpringBeepâ¢

The bicycle system's SpringBeep is a battery-powered, frame-integrated speaker providing audible notice-of-presence (âNOPâ) to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians in proximity. SpringBeep also enables SpringNannyâ¢, the bicycle system's SpringPorted-Device monitoring system, as well as the bicycle system's SpringGuardâ¢ theft alarm.

A schematic example of a frame-integrated speaker providing audible notice-of-presence is shown inFIG. 42.

SpringBriteâ¢

Lighting is a crucial safety component. In an example, the bicycle system delivers with SpringBrite its comprehensive lighting system. SpringBrite's frame-integrated projection element may provide white, high-intensity path lighting and may be auto-activated by SpringSmart when ambient light conditions fall below pre-set levels. An example of a frame-integrated projection element providing high-intensity path lighting is shown inFIG. 43.

In an example, SpringBrite's NOP elements are high-intensity, constant-state lights integrated into the bicycle system's front and rear hubs (white and red, respectively) and the rear of its saddle (red) to provide NOP to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians in proximity. NOP lights may be auto-activated upon SpringPorting a Device and are protected by polycarbonate lenses engineered to resist impact and maximize visibility.

A front hub may include a first light on a left side of the hub and a second light on a right side of the hub. An example is shown inFIG. 44. A saddle may include a light on a rear of the saddle. An example is shown inFIG. 45. A rear hub may include a first light on a left side of the hub and a second light on a right side of the hub. An example is shown inFIG. 46.

In an example, SpringBrite's indication lights (âIndicatorsâ) enable users to signal to others of impending actions. High intensity, handlebar-integrated, amber Indicators may provide flashing left/right turn signals to motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. Turn Indicators are controlled via the bicycle system's left-side three-button switch.

A handle bar may include an indicator on the front of the handlebar which when lit shines light in front of the bicycle system. A handle bar may include an indicator on a side of a handlebar which when lit shines light to the side of the bicycle system. An example of a lit forward facing indicator and a lit sideways facing indicator is shown inFIG. 47a. An example of an unlit forward facing indicator and an unlit sideways facing indicator is shown inFIG. 47b.

SpringBrite's speed reduction Indicator may automatically increase the brightness of the bicycle system's saddle integrated red NOP light to signal a user's reduction in speed.

An example of a bicycle system in which the front hub lights are lit, in which the rear hub lights are lit, and in which a saddle light, which is a speed reduction indicator, is lit, is shown inFIG. 48.

Health

Biking is universally acknowledged as being part of a healthy lifestyle; however, âbikersâ are but a small portion of the overall population. By targeting the considerably larger LPACs segment, the bicycle system will bring biking's health benefits to a much broader audience.

Carbon Monoxide Alerts

SpringSmart may actively monitor ambient carbon monoxide (âCOâ) via SpringSense and provides alert notices of unhealthy levels via SpringApp. Examples of related screen output are shown inFIG. 23a,FIG. 23b,FIG. 23c, andFIG. 23d,

Third Party Developers

In an example, SpringSense derived electrocardiography (ECG), temperature, humidity, and CO data is available to third party developers for use in creating a variety of applications that will enhance riding experience and support efforts to adopt healthier lifestyles.

Security

Road and mountain bike enthusiasts often spend upwards of $30,000 on their bikes. City dwellers look for dependability at the lowest possible price. This disparity is primarily attributable to theft.

When a ride is completed, road and mountain bikers store their precious mounts in secure locations. Yet, for urban cyclists, a ârideâ may occur 200+ times a year, and the vast majority will include a series of shorter âtripsâ, many of which leave urban bikes exposed to theft. Furthermore, the more expensive the bike, the more likely it is to be stolen or stripped for parts.

SpringGuardâ¢

In an example, the bicycle system's SpringGuardâ¢ system eliminates theft as an objection to premium pricing. Its formidable theft deterrence arsenal may employ a layered system which may include the following features:

SpringLocâ¢

An example of an engaged locking system in which a lock has disabled a bicycle system's crank axle is shown inFIG. 49a. An example of a disengaged locking system in which a lock has been released from a bicycle system's crank axle is shown inFIG. 49b.

SpringLincâ¢

An example of a retractable cable which has been used to secure a bicycle system to a bicycle stand is shown inFIG. 50.

SpringApp's âFindâ Feature

FIG. 24,FIG. 25,FIG. 26,FIG. 27aandFIG. 27bshow examples of screen output which relate to lost or stolen bicycle system location tracking.

SpringNannyâ¢

Industrial Design

SpringGuard's layered approach to theft deterrence is calculated to make the bicycle system the least desirable cycle amongst bike thieves. Successfully executing a bicycle system theft will involve a much higher level of risk than that associated with any other bicycle model. Additionally, if a bicycle system is stolen, the thief ends up with a bike that cannot be ridden; components that have little value; and markedly higher exposure to criminal prosecution due to âFindâ's tracking feature.

Maintenance

Many of today's cyclists are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with performing routine maintenance and repairs on their bikes. They rely on third party bike shops to fulfill this function, often waiting until a component fails catastrophically to seek assistance, when performing maintenance in a more expeditious manner would have saved time and money.

While some user interaction is still required on maintenance, repair, and replacement issues, in an example the bicycle system takes much of the stress of its upkeep out of users' hands by monitoring wear on essential components and providing notification if attention is required. Additionally, a user may contact SpringCycles for assistance via remote diagnosis, thus adding an additional layer of comfort that a user's bicycle system will be kept in top condition.

Status

In an example, SpringApp's âStatusâ feature is a user's primary source of maintenance-related information. âStatusâ may leverage SpringSmart's algorithmic analysis of SpringSense-captured data to predict wear experienced by a bicycle system's CVT, brakes, wheels, tires, SpringPort, and electrical components. âStatusâ may then utilize this predictive data to provide a user with detailed status reports on key components, along with maintenance recommendations for each. âStatusâ may also track maintenance, repairs and replacements performed and auto-notify users of required or scheduled maintenance via SpringCom's notice lights and SMS notifications. Other than in cases of emergency, maintenance notifications may be batched and sent when a user's Device is not SpringPorted. âStatusâ may additionally act as a repository for warranty eligibility reports generated by SpringSmart from SpringSense-captured data. Warranty reports accessed through SpringApp cover frame-stress levels experienced, distance traveled, and hours of usage. SpringApp's âStatusâ feature may also allow a user experiencing system issues to request remote diagnosis from the SpringCycles' bicycle system Assistance Program (âCAPâ). CAP personnel can then determine if and when components need to be serviced, replaced, or repaired.

SpringApp's âStatusâ Feature

An App running on a smartphone which is docked to the bicycle system may provide a status screen which shows maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system. A selectable touch screen icon may be provided which if selected by a user provides further maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system. A selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component may be provided which if selected by a user provides maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component. An example of a status screen which shows maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system is shown inFIG. 51. An example of a sample of a sequence of screen output provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component in which maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component are provided is shown inFIG. 52aand inFIG. 52b. A swipeable sequence of screen output may be provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon relating to a bicycle system component in which maintenance instructions which relate to the bicycle system component are provided. Examples of screen output provided in response to selection of a selectable touch screen icon, which if selected by a user provides further maintenance data which relates to the bicycle system, is shown inFIG. 53a,FIG. 53b,FIG. 53c, andFIG. 53d. A selectable touch screen icon may be provided to send a report to a central reporting server. An example is shown inFIG. 53d. A confirmation screen may be provided for a user to confirm that the user wants to send a report to a central reporting server. An example is shown inFIG. 53e.

Accessories

While the bicycle system is loaded with features, many users will want to either personalize their bicycle system or better adapt certain features to their specific needs by adding certain accessories. SpringCycles may support users through its SpringLoadedâ¢ licensing program.

SpringLoadedâ¢

The bicycle system's unique industrial design presents a robust platform for mounting a range of accessories. Third party developers committed to matching the bicycle system's elegance, functionality, and rigorous quality standards may receive a license to produce accessories carrying the SpringLoaded mark. SpringLoaded accessories may be available for purchase at launch.

A platform for mounting accessories may be provided above a rear wheel of the bicycle system. The platform may be a platform which is elongate in the direction from the saddle to the rear of the bicycle system. The platform may include a recess for receiving an accessory, wherein the recess extends along the elongate platform. The platform may be in attachment with a saddle support. The platform may include a spur arranged to abut against a frame of the bicycle system, the spur providing support for the platform in a loaded configuration of the platform. An example is shown inFIG. 54. An example of a platform in an unloaded configuration is shown inFIG. 55a. An example of a platform in a loaded configuration is shown inFIG. 55b.

Packaging

âUnboxingâ can be a delightful bonding moment between user and product. The bicycle system's packaging, SpringBoxâ¢, is designed to provide that very experience.

SpringBoxâ¢

While sealed, SpringBox's premium materials, construction, and graphic design combine to powerfully signal that SpringBox contains something special. Users will also note that SpringBox is extremely easy to openâin an example, three turns with a medium-sized coin inserted into SpringBox's quick-release locks is all that is required. SpringBox may then open from the top and one side to display its contents.

While the newly revealed bicycle system will understandably take center stage, users will, if only subconsciously, sense the care and attention to detail put into ensuring each bicycle system arrives in pristine, ready-to-ride condition. Users will note the precisely fitted bio-foam insets used to fully isolate and protect the bicycle system from even excessive mishandling during transport. They will also recognize that SpringBox is far more than mere packaging, that it is actually a valuable accessory intended to be used on an ongoing basis for storage and/or future transport needs. An example of a bicycle system's packaging in an open configuration is shown on the left hand side ofFIG. 56. An example of a set of five bicycle systems' packaging in a closed configuration is shown on the right hand side ofFIG. 56.

Users will be relieved to find an absence of zip-ties, twist-ties, and the virtually indestructible plastic packing materials so common in consumer products. In fact, the same coin used to open SpringBox may release its internal fastenings, allowing the bicycle system to be removed with a gentle tug. Initial setup may then proceed in the following manner:

In an example, by delivering a fully assembled bicycle system (including nitrogen-filled tires and partially charged batteries), SpringBox ensures a user can enjoy their first ride within 30 minutes of beginning the unboxing process.

Remarks

Having reached this stage, we hope you agree that the bicycle system is the bike consumers want. We have shown how the bicycle system makes a smartphone integral to its unprecedented feature-set and, consequently, to how consumers will see it complementing and enhancing their lives. We have also demonstrated how navigation, security, and ride quality can all become groundbreaking innovations in their own right.

While innovation, artful design, and flawless integration all make us happy, we view them merely as footnotes to fantastic user experiences leading to healthier lifestyles. Our goal is simpleâpure delight each and every time a user SpringPorts a smartphone device and rides away.

We look forward to providing the chance for you to take a ride of your own.

Design Comments Relating to Example Bicycle Systems

TechnoCraft

The exploration of design themes and identification of vital focal points was required at inception in order for the design team to attain the balance of aesthetics, performance, and ergonomics called for in the bicycle system's design brief. The briefs requisite blend of modernism with traditionalism, technology with craft, was met through a harmonious interdisciplinary approach formed by design and engineering. Working together required each group to consider all major bike nodes (seating, pedaling, transmission, handlebars, steering tube, etc.) from the other's perspective. Moreover, it ensured that the bicycle system embodied what came to be known as âTechnoCraftâ.

Frame, Forks & Fenders

âLinear Fluencyâ informed the overall look and feel of the bicycle system's frame. The frame's strong linear lines âspillâ onto fenders, integrating them visually into the frame.

Crank & Kickstand

The crank is the central hub for a number of the bicycle system's design elements. It is suspended from the frame to create an iconic silhouette. Careful consideration was also given to the type of kickstand to be used, and after extensive testing, a crank-stand was found to be the most effective from an engineering standpoint, while it also proved to be the most complementary with the bicycle system's frame design.

SpringCom

High content absorption and low distraction were the touchstones for SpringCom's user/bike interface. Device placement, therefore, was key, as were adjustability, comfort, and user stimulus. Careful attention was given to control switch manipulation and finger articulation. User interaction with the bicycle system was carefully considered and included ideas such as a combination of haptic feedback and light-based notices. âNotification fatigueâ and distraction were also a concern, and various methods of stimuli to address, inform, and warn were considered.

Saddle & Seat Post

The bicycle system's saddle design balances intelligence and style. Moreover, due to the saddle's role as a key user/bicycle system interface, ergonomic analysis was required to create a design that would deliver all-day comfort as well.

The bicycle system's seat post design seamlessly integrates directly into the bicycle system's unique frame shape. This results in the seat post fitting the bicycle system exclusively and, consequently, making it less desirable to those thieves who specialize in stripping bikes of valuable components. The seat post also integrates a PTFE bearing material to reduce friction and wear, thus enhancing user experience by eliminating the aggravating sticking aspect of traditional systems.
