DESCRIPTION:
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThe present application is a continuation of, and claims priority benefit to, co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. non-provisional patent application entitled, âSMART WATCH,â application Ser. No. 15/370,915, filed Dec. 6, 2016, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. non-provisional patent application entitled, âSMART WATCH,â application Ser. No. 14/707,926, filed May 8, 2015. The above-identified applications are hereby incorporated by reference into the current application in their entirety.BACKGROUNDWatches are portable timepieces configured to be carried or worn by a user, thus allowing the user to determine the time in a convenient manner. A wristwatch is a watch configured to be worn on a wrist of the user, and is attached to the wrist by a wrist strap such as a leather strap, plastic band, or metal bracelet. A pocket watch is a watch that is configured to be carried in a pocket of a garment worn by the user. Traditionally, watches have displayed the time using an analog display comprised of a face having a watch dial, over which a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand are disposed. Many watches also incorporate a third, rotating second hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Digital watches employ a digital display (e.g., a Light Emitting Diode (LED), a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), etc.) in place of the analog display and rotating hands.Smart watches are watches, typically wristwatches, which furnish functionality that is enhanced beyond timekeeping. For example, some smart watches comprise wearable electronic devices that can execute applications or apps, play back digital media, and furnish Internet connectivity. Some smart watches are further equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to furnish location-based functionality. Smart watches typically employ a display device for displaying information to a user. Many smart watches further utilize touchscreens to facilitate interaction by the user with information displayed by the display device.SUMMARYA smart watch is disclosed that comprises a display device over which analog rotating hands are disposed. In embodiments, the smart watch comprises a case having a face, in which a display device is disposed to display information to a user of the smart watch. Analog watch arms disposed over the display device are configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations to support the display of information by the display device. In one or more embodiments, a bezel is disposed in the face of the case around the display device. The bezel is configured to be rotated with respect to the display device to select a mode of operation of the smart watch, wherein the analog watch arms may be independently rotated between one or more configurations in response to the mode of operation selected.This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

For example, smart watches can execute applications or apps, play back digital media, furnish cellular telephone and Internet connectivity (e.g., via a link with another device such as a smart phone), track parameter related to a user's fitness, and furnish location-based functionality such as mapping, turn by turn directions, and so forth. Smart watches typically employ a small digital display for displaying information to a user and input/output devices such as buttons and/or a touchscreens overlaying the display to facilitate interaction by the user with information displayed by the display device.Many persons who wear wrist watches find the digital display employed by most smart watches unattractive. In response, smart watch designers have often attempted to emulate conventional watches by causing the watch's display device to display indicia mimicking the dial and watch arms of an analog watch. Nevertheless, many wristwatch wearers still prefer the appearance of analog wrist watches, which they find more aesthetically appealing. However, conventional watches employ movements that utilize a common gear (wheel) train to turn the watch arms. Thus, the motion of each of the watch arms is tied to the rotation of the other watch arms (e.g., the minute hand rotates one increment each time the second hand sweeps the dial, the hour hand rotates one increment each time the minute hand sweeps the watch dial, and so forth). Consequently, the use of conventional analog watch arms in combination with a display of a smart watch is impractical since the analog watch arms would obscure the display or limit the size and shape of the display.Accordingly, a smart watch is disclosed that comprises a case having a face that includes a display device configured to display information to a user of the smart watch. One or more analog watch arms are disposed on the face over the display device. For example, in embodiments, an analog first watch arm (e.g., an âhour handâ) and a second analog watch arm (e.g., âminute handâ) may be disposed over the display device in the face. Additional analog watch arms may be provided. For example, an analog third watch arm (e.g., a âsecond handâ) may be disposed over the display. Watch arms may be coaxial (i.e., rotate about the same axis), non-coaxial, or both.In accordance with the present disclosure, one or more watch arms (e.g., the first watch arm, the second watch arm, the third watch arm, etc.) are capable of independently rotating to support the display of information by the display device. For example, the watch arms may be configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations to support the display of information by the display device thereby improving the user experience. In embodiments, a watch arm drive disposed within the case may independently rotate the watch arms between one or more configurations. A bezel may be disposed in the face of the case around the display device. The bezel is configured to be rotated with respect to the display device to select a mode of operation of the smart watch. One or more of the watch arms may be independently rotated between one or more configurations by the watch arm drive in response to the mode of operation selected.In embodiments, when the bezel is rotated to select a mode of operation that causes the smart watch to furnish timekeeping functionality, the display device may be configured to display a watch dial, and the watch arms independently rotated to a first configuration, wherein the watch arms are configured to indicate a time of day. When the watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first watch arm may, for example, be rotated to a first position, while the second watch arm is rotated to a second position about the axis independently of the first watch arm, the second position being collinear with and opposite the first position with respect to the axis of rotation. The watch arms rotate to a fixed position. In this manner, the watch arms may quickly position themselves (e.g., horizontally, at the nine (9) o'clock and three (3) o'clock positions, respectively, vertically, at the twelve (12) o'clock and six (6) o'clock positions, respectively, and so forth) to support viewing of information displayed by the display device. In other examples, when the watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first position may be fixed with respect to the second position, so that the first watch arm and second watch arm and any additional watch arms, if provided, may rotate about the axis. For example, the display device may be configured to display a compass rose, while the watch arms form a compass needle configured to indicate a direction on the compass rose. In further examples, when watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first watch arm may be rotated to a first position about the axis, while the second watch arm and any additional watch arms, if provided, are rotated to a second position overlaying (or underlying) the first position. Thus, the display device may be configured to display a dial, while the watch arms form a pointer configured to indicate a reading on the dial.In the following discussion, an example smart watch employing independently rotatable watch arms is first described. Example functionality is then described that may be implemented by the smart watch in accordance with the present disclosure.Example EnvironmentFIGS. 1A and 1Billustrate asmart watch100in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, thesmart watch100comprises acase102having aface104, side surfaces106, and a back (not shown). In the embodiment illustrated, thesmart watch100comprises a wristwatch designed to be worn about the wrist of a user. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that thesmart watch100may comprise a pocket watch, a pendant watch, and so forth. When configured as a wristwatch, as shown inFIG. 1A, thesmart watch100further includes awristband108that is attached to the case via pins (not shown) that engage lugs110formed in thecase102. Thewristband108comprisesstraps112,114having aclosure116such as a buckle, a deployant clasp, or the like. Thestraps112,114, may be formed of a variety of materials including, but not limited to: leather, metal (e.g., stainless steel, gold, silver, etc.), canvas, or synthetic materials such as fluoroelastomer, nylon fabric, silicone, or the like. In other embodiments, thewristband108may comprise a metal bracelet such as link bracelet, a loop bracelet, or a mesh bracelet, which may flex to permit a user to put the smart watch on his or her wrist, or may include aclosure116such as a folding clasp, a hidden clasp, or the like.Adisplay device118is disposed in theface104of thesmart watch100to display information to the user. As shown, thedisplay device118may be generally circular (round) in shape, and may occupy substantially all of theface104of thesmart watch100. In the embodiment shown, thedisplay device118may employ an electrophoretic ink display such as an E INK display (E INK is a registered trademark of E Ink Corporation, Cambridge, Mass.) configured to display text and/or graphical information such as a graphical user interface. However, in other embodiments, thedisplay device118may comprise an LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode) display, a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD display, an LEP (Light Emitting Polymer) or PLED (Polymer Light Emitting Diode) display, and so forth. Thedisplay118may utilize ambient lighting to permit viewing of displayed information, may be backlit via a backlight such that it may be viewed in the dark or other low-light environments, may be frontlit, or may employ no light source at all.One or more rotating analog watcharms120,122,124are disposed on theface104of thesmart watch100over thedisplay device118. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, thesmart watch100includes an analog first watch arm (e.g., an âhour handâ)120, an analog second watch arm (e.g., a âminute handâ)122, and an analog third watch arm (e.g., a âsecond handâ or âsweep handâ)124in theface104over thedisplay device118so that thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124rotate about a common axis of rotation126(seeFIG. 2). Watch arms may be coaxially mounted, non-coaxially mounted, or both. As shown, thefirst watch arm120,second watch arm122, andthird watch arm124may be independently coupled to a watch arm drive128so that thewatch arms120,122,124are capable of independently rotating to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. For example, thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124may be configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations so that information may be displayed by thedisplay device118without unnecessary obstruction by thewatch arms120,122,124. In embodiments, the watch arm drive128may independently rotate thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124between the first configuration and the second configuration. Thus, unlike the movement of a conventional watch, in which the watch arms are driven by a wheel gear train and move in a defined relationship to one another, the watch arm drive128may turn eachwatch arm120,122,124independently of theother watch arms120,122,124between the first configuration and the second configuration.Thesmart watch100further includes abezel130disposed in theface104of thecase102around thedisplay device118. Thebezel130is configured to be rotated by the user about thedisplay device118to select a mode of operation of thesmart watch100. For example, thebezel130may be provided withmultiple mode selections132, which are rotated by the user to aselection detent position134to select the mode of operation of thesmart watch100. As discussed herein, the watch arms (e.g., thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and the third watch arm124) may be independently rotated between configurations depending on themode selection132chosen.Awatch crystal136is provided over thewatch arms120,122,124and thedisplay device118. For example, as shown inFIG. 1A, a cavity may be formed in theface104of thecase102within thebezel130over thedisplay device118, in which thewatch arms120,122,124are disposed and rotate. Thewatch crystal136is positioned within thebezel130and encloses thedisplay device118and watcharms120,122,124within the cavity to protect thedisplay device118and watcharms120,122,124from the environment. In embodiments, the watch crystal may be formed of a suitable material such plastic, glass, mineral glass, synthetic sapphire, and so forth.In an embodiment, thewatch crystal136can be provided with atouch screen138for entry of data and commands. In one or more implementations, thetouch screen138can be a resistive touch screen, a capacitive touch screen, combinations thereof, and the like. Capacitive touch screens can include surface capacitance touch screens, projected capacitance touch screens, mutual capacitance touch screens, and self-capacitance touch screens. In implementations, thetouch screen138is configured with hardware to generate a signal to send to aprocessor150and/or driver upon detection of a touch input and/or a hover input. As indicated herein, touch inputs include inputs, gestures, and movements where the input contacts thetouch screen138. Hover inputs include inputs, gestures, and movements where the input does not contact thetouch screen138, but is detected proximal to thetouch screen138.Thesmart watch100further includes one or more control buttons (fivecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148are illustrated) positioned in theside surface106of thecase102. Thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148are operable to control functionality of thesmart watch100. For example, one or more of thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148may be selected (depressed) in response to information displayed by thedisplay device118to provide inputs to control operation of thesmart watch100. In embodiments, where thesmart watch100includes atouch screen138, thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148may be used in conjunction with thetouch screen138.As shown inFIG. 1B, thesmart watch100is illustrated as including aprocessor150and amemory152. Theprocessor150provides processing functionality for thesmart watch100and can include any number of processors, micro-controllers, or other processing systems, and resident or external memory for storing data and other information accessed or generated by thesmart watch100. Theprocessor150can execute one or more software programs (e.g., an operating system (OS), a user interface (UI), applications, etc.) that implement the techniques and modules described herein. Theprocessor150is not limited by the materials from which it is formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein and, as such, can be implemented via semiconductor(s) and/or transistors (e.g., electronic integrated circuits (ICs)), and so forth.Thememory152is an example of a tangible, non-transient device-readable storage media that provides storage functionality to store various data associated with the operation of thesmart watch100, such as the software program and code segments mentioned above, or other data to instruct theprocessor150and other elements of thesmart watch100to perform the techniques described herein. Although asingle memory152is shown, a wide variety of types and combinations of memory can be employed. Thememory152can be integral with theprocessor150, stand-alone memory, or a combination of both. Thememory152can include, for example, removable and non-removable memory elements such as RAM, ROM, Flash (e.g., SD Card, mini-SD card, micro-SD Card), magnetic, optical, USB memory devices, and so forth. In embodiments of thesmart watch100, thememory152can include removable ICC (Integrated Circuit Card) memory such as provided by SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards, USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) cards, UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Cards), and so forth.Thesmart watch100is further illustrated as including functionality to determine and/or display position. More particularly,smart watch100can include or be coupled to a position-determiningsystem154that can manage and process signal data received from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites via aGPS receiver156. The position-determiningsystem154is representative of functionality operable to determine and/or display a geographic position through processing of the received signal data. The signal data can include various data suitable for use in position determination, such as timing signals, ranging signals, ephemerides, almanacs, and so forth.The position-determiningsystem154can also be configured to provide a variety of other position-determining functionality. Position-determining functionality, for purposes of discussion herein, can relate to a variety of different navigation techniques and other techniques that can be supported by âknowingâ one or more positions. For instance, position-determining functionality can be employed to provide position/location information, timing information, speed information, and a variety of other navigation-related data. Accordingly, the position-determiningsystem154can be configured in a variety of ways to perform a wide variety of functions. For example, the position-determiningsystem154can be configured for outdoor navigation, vehicle navigation, aerial navigation (e.g., for airplanes, helicopters), marine navigation, personal use (e.g., as a part of fitness-related equipment), golf, and so forth. Accordingly, the position-determiningsystem154can include a variety of devices to determine position using one or more of the techniques previously described.The position-determiningsystem154, for instance, can use signal data received via theGPS receiver156in combination with map data that is stored in thememory152or received from paired device or remote source to generate navigation instructions (e.g., turn-by-turn instructions to an input destination or POI), show a current position on a map, and so on. The position-determiningsystem154can include one or more antennas to receive signal data as well as to perform other communications, such as communication with a paired device or communication via one or more networks described in more detail below. The position-determiningsystem154can also provide other position-determining functionality, such as to determine an average speed, calculate an arrival time, determine a distance and/or direction to a target location (e.g., a pin in a hole of golf), and so on.Although a GPS system is described and illustrated in relation toFIG. 1B, it should be apparent that a wide variety of other positioning systems can also be employed, such as other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), terrestrial based systems (e.g., wireless phone-based systems that broadcast position data from cellular towers), wireless networks that transmit positioning signals, and so on. For example, positioning-determining functionality can be implemented through the use of a server in a server-based architecture, from a ground-based infrastructure, through one or more sensors, use of âdead reckoningâ techniques, and so on.Thesmart watch100can also include acommunication system158configured to furnish communication functionality to permit thesmart watch100to send/receive data with one or more paired devices such as a paired smart phone, or the like, and/or over one or more wireless networks.

The user interface160can provide functionality to allow the user to interact with one ormore applications162of thesmart watch100by providing inputs via thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148and/or thetouch screen138. The user interface160can cause an application programming interface (API) to be generated to expose functionality to anapplication162to configure the application for display by thedisplay device118. In embodiments, the API can further expose functionality to configure theapplication162to allow the user to interact with an application by providing inputs via thebezel130,control buttons140,142,144,146,148, and/or thetouchscreen138.Applications162, which may include applications, mobile applications (mobile apps), and so forth, comprise software, which is storable inmemory152and executable by theprocessor150, to perform a specific operation or group of operations to furnish functionality to thesmart watch100.Applications162can include browser applications, cellular telephone applications, instant messaging applications, email applications, photograph sharing applications, calendar applications, address book applications, media player applications, fitness/health monitoring applications, sport related applications, navigation related applications, combinations thereof, and so forth.Example applications162are described in the discussion ofFIGS. 13A through 19C.In embodiments, the user interface160may further include a browser. The browser enables thesmart watch100to display and interact with content such as a webpage within the World Wide Web, a webpage provided by a web server in a private network, and so forth. In some embodiments, the browser may be implemented as anapplication162that may be stored in memory and executed by theprocessor150.Thesmart watch100is illustrated as including a watcharm control module164, which is storable inmemory152and executable by theprocessor150. The watcharm control module164represents functionality to furnish control of the watch arm drive128to independently turn thewatch arms120,122,124as described herein below with respect toFIGS. 2 and 3A through 3E. The functionality represented by the watcharm control module164may thus be employed in concert with functionality provided by the user interface160andapplications162to support the display of information to the user of thesmart watch100via thedisplay device118. The watcharm control module164may receive inputs from thebezel130,control buttons140,142,144,146,148, and/or thetouch screen138, for example, via the user interface160. The watcharm control module164may then cause the watch arm drive128to turn thewatch arms120,122,124in a manner indicated by the inputs made.Thesmart watch100is further illustrated as including amotion sensor166that detects motion (movement) of thesmart watch100.

As shown, theshaft end122A of the second (minute)watch arm122is coupled to, and rotated by, anoutermost shaft204; while theshaft end120A of the first watch (hour)hand120is coupled to, and rotated by, anintermediate shaft202, which extends above theoutermost shaft204; and theshaft end124A of the third watch (second or sweep)hand124is coupled to, and rotated by, aninnermost shaft206, which extends above theintermediate shaft202with respect to the surface of thedisplay device118.The watch arm drive128may drive each of theshafts202,204,206independently of one another in either the clockwise or counterclockwise directions with respect to the common axis ofrotation126. In this manner, the watch arm drive128can rotate any of thewatch arms120,122,124, either clockwise or counterclockwise, in response to commands from the watch arm control module164(FIG. 1B) to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. For example, the watch arm drive128can independently turn the respectivecoaxial drive shafts202,204,206to rotate thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124between one or more configurations to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. In embodiments, the watch arm drive128may include one or more motors and associated gear trains to independently drive (turn) each of theshafts202,204,206to rotate each of therespective watch arms120,122,124. Thus, unlike the movement of a conventional watch, in which the watch arms are driven in a clockwise direction by a single wheel (gear) train and move in a defined relationship to one another, the watch arm drive128may turn eachwatch arm120,122,124independently of theother watch arms120,122,124, either clockwise or counterclockwise.FIGS. 3A through 3Edepict theface104of thesmart watch100, wherein the analog watcharms120,122,124are rotated between example first andsecond configurations302,304,306,308,310. It will be appreciated that the illustratedconfigurations302,304,306,308,310shown inFIGS. 3A through 3E, and discussed herein, as well as any other contemplated configurations, may be considered a first configuration or a second configuration as those terms are used herein. Consequently, any of theconfigurations302,304,306,308,310can be a âfirst configurationâ from which thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any other of theconfigurations302,304,306,308,310, which may be considered a âsecond configuration.â Further, as discussed below, in any or all of the configurations shown302,304,306,308,310, any or all of thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotatable (either clockwise or counterclockwise); may be fixed (stationary) in relation to thedisplay device118andface104; or may be fixed in relation to one another but rotatable (either clockwise or counterclockwise) in relation to thedisplay device118andface104. Moreover, it is contemplated that thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any combination of positions (fixed and/or rotatable) as required to support the display of information by thedisplay device118.InFIG. 3A, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown in an example configuration (hereinafter the âtimekeeping configurationâ302), wherein thedisplay device118is configured to display awatch dial312, and thewatch arms120,122,124are rotated in relation to one another to indicate a time of day in the manner of a conventional watch or clock. Thus, in the illustratedtimekeeping configuration302, the third watch arm (second or sweep hand)124makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every sixty (60) seconds; the second watch arm (minute hand)122moves one increment of thewatch dial312each time the third watch arm (second or sweep hand)124makes one rotation of thewatch dial312and makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every sixty (60) minutes; and the first watch arm (hour hand)120moves one increment of thewatch dial312each time the second watch arm (minute hand)122makes one rotation of thewatch dial312and makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every twelve (12) hours when the watch dial is configured as a twelve (12) hour dial, or, once every twenty-four (24) hours if thewatch dial312is configured as a twenty-four (24) hour dial (e.g., complying with international standard ISO 8601).InFIGS. 3B and 3C, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown rotated toadditional example configurations304,306. In these configurations, first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124are rotated to fixed (stationary) positions314,316in relation to thedisplay device118and face104to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. In the embodiment illustrated, thefirst watch arm120is rotated to a firstfixed position314, while thesecond watch arm122and thethird watch arm124are each rotated to a secondfixed position316about the common axis ofrotation126independently of thefirst watch arm120and one another. As shown, the secondfixed position316is collinear with and opposite the firstfixed position314with respect to the axis ofrotation126. InFIG. 3B, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown oriented horizontally (hereinafter the âhorizontal fixed configurationâ304), with thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120at the nine (9) o'clock position and the pointer ends122B,124B of the second and third watcharms122,124, respectively, at the three (3) o'clock position of thewatch dial312. However, depending on the positions of thewatch arms120,122,124prior to rotation to the horizontal fixedconfiguration304, thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120can also be rotated to the three (3) o'clock position while the pointer ends122B,124B of either or both of the second and third watcharms122,124can be rotated to the nine (9) o'clock position of thewatch dial312. Similarly, inFIG. 3C, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown oriented vertically, with thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120at the six (6) o'clock position and the pointer ends122B,124B of the second and third watcharms122,124, respectively, at the twelve (12) o'clock position of the watch dial312(hereinafter the âvertical fixed configurationâ306). Again, depending on the positions of thewatch arms120,122,124prior to rotation to thesecond configuration304, thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120can also be rotated to the twelve (12) o'clock position while the pointer ends122B,124B of the second and third watcharms122,124, respectively, can be rotated to the six (6) o'clock position of thewatch dial312. In this manner, thewatch arms120,122,124may be quickly positioned (e.g., horizontally, at the nine (9) o'clock and three (3) o'clock positions, respectively, vertically, at the twelve (12) o'clock and six (6) o'clock positions, respectively) to support viewing of information displayed by thedisplay device118. It is contemplated that, in another configuration, thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any combination of fixed positions with respect to thedisplay device118as required to support the display of information by the display device118(e.g., thefirst watch arm120to the seven (7) o'clock and second and third watcharms122,124to the five (5) o'clock positions; thefirst watch arm120to the ten (10) o'clock and the second and third watcharms122,124to the one (1) o'clock positions; all watcharms120,122,124to the six (6) o'clock position; all watcharms120,122,124to the twelve (12) o'clock position, and so forth).InFIGS. 3D and 3E, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown inexample configurations308,310, wherein the positions of thewatch arms120,120,124are fixed with respect to one another, but can rotate with respect to thedisplay device118. InFIG. 3D, thefirst watch arm120is rotated to afirst position318, while thesecond watch arm122and thethird watch arm124are each rotated to asecond position320about the axis ofrotation126independently of thefirst watch arm120and one another. As shown, thesecond position320is collinear with and opposite thefirst position314with respect to the common axis ofrotation126. Thesecond position320is further fixed with respect to thefirst position318so that the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124form aneedle322having first and second ends322A,322B that is pivoted to rotate about the axis ofrotation126. In this configuration (hereinafter the âneedle configurationâ308), for example, thedisplay device118may be configured to display acompass rose324, while theneedle322functions as a compass needle configured to indicate a direction on the compass rose324(see the discussion ofFIG. 10). Similarly, inFIG. 3E, the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124are shown rotated about the common axis ofrotation126so that thesecond position320overlays (or underlays) the first position318(e.g., to a common position) to form apointer326. In this configuration (hereinafter the âpointer configurationâ310), thedisplay device118may be configured to display adial328, wherein thepointer326is configured to indicate a reading on thedial328.FIG. 4further illustrates operation of thebezel130.

The above-identified applications are hereby incorporated by reference into the current application in their entirety.BACKGROUNDWatches are portable timepieces configured to be carried or worn by a user, thus allowing the user to determine the time in a convenient manner. A wristwatch is a watch configured to be worn on a wrist of the user, and is attached to the wrist by a wrist strap such as a leather strap, plastic band, or metal bracelet. A pocket watch is a watch that is configured to be carried in a pocket of a garment worn by the user. Traditionally, watches have displayed the time using an analog display comprised of a face having a watch dial, over which a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand are disposed. Many watches also incorporate a third, rotating second hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Digital watches employ a digital display (e.g., a Light Emitting Diode (LED), a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), etc.) in place of the analog display and rotating hands.Smart watches are watches, typically wristwatches, which furnish functionality that is enhanced beyond timekeeping. For example, some smart watches comprise wearable electronic devices that can execute applications or apps, play back digital media, and furnish Internet connectivity. Some smart watches are further equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to furnish location-based functionality. Smart watches typically employ a display device for displaying information to a user. Many smart watches further utilize touchscreens to facilitate interaction by the user with information displayed by the display device.SUMMARYA smart watch is disclosed that comprises a display device over which analog rotating hands are disposed. In embodiments, the smart watch comprises a case having a face, in which a display device is disposed to display information to a user of the smart watch. Analog watch arms disposed over the display device are configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations to support the display of information by the display device.

For example, smart watches can execute applications or apps, play back digital media, furnish cellular telephone and Internet connectivity (e.g., via a link with another device such as a smart phone), track parameter related to a user's fitness, and furnish location-based functionality such as mapping, turn by turn directions, and so forth. Smart watches typically employ a small digital display for displaying information to a user and input/output devices such as buttons and/or a touchscreens overlaying the display to facilitate interaction by the user with information displayed by the display device.Many persons who wear wrist watches find the digital display employed by most smart watches unattractive. In response, smart watch designers have often attempted to emulate conventional watches by causing the watch's display device to display indicia mimicking the dial and watch arms of an analog watch. Nevertheless, many wristwatch wearers still prefer the appearance of analog wrist watches, which they find more aesthetically appealing. However, conventional watches employ movements that utilize a common gear (wheel) train to turn the watch arms. Thus, the motion of each of the watch arms is tied to the rotation of the other watch arms (e.g., the minute hand rotates one increment each time the second hand sweeps the dial, the hour hand rotates one increment each time the minute hand sweeps the watch dial, and so forth). Consequently, the use of conventional analog watch arms in combination with a display of a smart watch is impractical since the analog watch arms would obscure the display or limit the size and shape of the display.Accordingly, a smart watch is disclosed that comprises a case having a face that includes a display device configured to display information to a user of the smart watch. One or more analog watch arms are disposed on the face over the display device. For example, in embodiments, an analog first watch arm (e.g., an âhour handâ) and a second analog watch arm (e.g., âminute handâ) may be disposed over the display device in the face. Additional analog watch arms may be provided. For example, an analog third watch arm (e.g., a âsecond handâ) may be disposed over the display. Watch arms may be coaxial (i.e., rotate about the same axis), non-coaxial, or both.In accordance with the present disclosure, one or more watch arms (e.g., the first watch arm, the second watch arm, the third watch arm, etc.) are capable of independently rotating to support the display of information by the display device. For example, the watch arms may be configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations to support the display of information by the display device thereby improving the user experience. In embodiments, a watch arm drive disposed within the case may independently rotate the watch arms between one or more configurations. A bezel may be disposed in the face of the case around the display device. The bezel is configured to be rotated with respect to the display device to select a mode of operation of the smart watch. One or more of the watch arms may be independently rotated between one or more configurations by the watch arm drive in response to the mode of operation selected.In embodiments, when the bezel is rotated to select a mode of operation that causes the smart watch to furnish timekeeping functionality, the display device may be configured to display a watch dial, and the watch arms independently rotated to a first configuration, wherein the watch arms are configured to indicate a time of day. When the watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first watch arm may, for example, be rotated to a first position, while the second watch arm is rotated to a second position about the axis independently of the first watch arm, the second position being collinear with and opposite the first position with respect to the axis of rotation. The watch arms rotate to a fixed position. In this manner, the watch arms may quickly position themselves (e.g., horizontally, at the nine (9) o'clock and three (3) o'clock positions, respectively, vertically, at the twelve (12) o'clock and six (6) o'clock positions, respectively, and so forth) to support viewing of information displayed by the display device. In other examples, when the watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first position may be fixed with respect to the second position, so that the first watch arm and second watch arm and any additional watch arms, if provided, may rotate about the axis. For example, the display device may be configured to display a compass rose, while the watch arms form a compass needle configured to indicate a direction on the compass rose. In further examples, when watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first watch arm may be rotated to a first position about the axis, while the second watch arm and any additional watch arms, if provided, are rotated to a second position overlaying (or underlying) the first position. Thus, the display device may be configured to display a dial, while the watch arms form a pointer configured to indicate a reading on the dial.In the following discussion, an example smart watch employing independently rotatable watch arms is first described. Example functionality is then described that may be implemented by the smart watch in accordance with the present disclosure.Example EnvironmentFIGS. 1A and 1Billustrate asmart watch100in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, thesmart watch100comprises acase102having aface104, side surfaces106, and a back (not shown). In the embodiment illustrated, thesmart watch100comprises a wristwatch designed to be worn about the wrist of a user. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that thesmart watch100may comprise a pocket watch, a pendant watch, and so forth. When configured as a wristwatch, as shown inFIG. 1A, thesmart watch100further includes awristband108that is attached to the case via pins (not shown) that engage lugs110formed in thecase102. Thewristband108comprisesstraps112,114having aclosure116such as a buckle, a deployant clasp, or the like. Thestraps112,114, may be formed of a variety of materials including, but not limited to: leather, metal (e.g., stainless steel, gold, silver, etc.), canvas, or synthetic materials such as fluoroelastomer, nylon fabric, silicone, or the like. In other embodiments, thewristband108may comprise a metal bracelet such as link bracelet, a loop bracelet, or a mesh bracelet, which may flex to permit a user to put the smart watch on his or her wrist, or may include aclosure116such as a folding clasp, a hidden clasp, or the like.Adisplay device118is disposed in theface104of thesmart watch100to display information to the user. As shown, thedisplay device118may be generally circular (round) in shape, and may occupy substantially all of theface104of thesmart watch100. In the embodiment shown, thedisplay device118may employ an electrophoretic ink display such as an E INK display (E INK is a registered trademark of E Ink Corporation, Cambridge, Mass.) configured to display text and/or graphical information such as a graphical user interface. However, in other embodiments, thedisplay device118may comprise an LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode) display, a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD display, an LEP (Light Emitting Polymer) or PLED (Polymer Light Emitting Diode) display, and so forth. Thedisplay118may utilize ambient lighting to permit viewing of displayed information, may be backlit via a backlight such that it may be viewed in the dark or other low-light environments, may be frontlit, or may employ no light source at all.One or more rotating analog watcharms120,122,124are disposed on theface104of thesmart watch100over thedisplay device118. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, thesmart watch100includes an analog first watch arm (e.g., an âhour handâ)120, an analog second watch arm (e.g., a âminute handâ)122, and an analog third watch arm (e.g., a âsecond handâ or âsweep handâ)124in theface104over thedisplay device118so that thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124rotate about a common axis of rotation126(seeFIG. 2). Watch arms may be coaxially mounted, non-coaxially mounted, or both. As shown, thefirst watch arm120,second watch arm122, andthird watch arm124may be independently coupled to a watch arm drive128so that thewatch arms120,122,124are capable of independently rotating to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. For example, thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124may be configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations so that information may be displayed by thedisplay device118without unnecessary obstruction by thewatch arms120,122,124. In embodiments, the watch arm drive128may independently rotate thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124between the first configuration and the second configuration. Thus, unlike the movement of a conventional watch, in which the watch arms are driven by a wheel gear train and move in a defined relationship to one another, the watch arm drive128may turn eachwatch arm120,122,124independently of theother watch arms120,122,124between the first configuration and the second configuration.Thesmart watch100further includes abezel130disposed in theface104of thecase102around thedisplay device118. Thebezel130is configured to be rotated by the user about thedisplay device118to select a mode of operation of thesmart watch100. For example, thebezel130may be provided withmultiple mode selections132, which are rotated by the user to aselection detent position134to select the mode of operation of thesmart watch100. As discussed herein, the watch arms (e.g., thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and the third watch arm124) may be independently rotated between configurations depending on themode selection132chosen.Awatch crystal136is provided over thewatch arms120,122,124and thedisplay device118. For example, as shown inFIG. 1A, a cavity may be formed in theface104of thecase102within thebezel130over thedisplay device118, in which thewatch arms120,122,124are disposed and rotate. Thewatch crystal136is positioned within thebezel130and encloses thedisplay device118and watcharms120,122,124within the cavity to protect thedisplay device118and watcharms120,122,124from the environment. In embodiments, the watch crystal may be formed of a suitable material such plastic, glass, mineral glass, synthetic sapphire, and so forth.In an embodiment, thewatch crystal136can be provided with atouch screen138for entry of data and commands. In one or more implementations, thetouch screen138can be a resistive touch screen, a capacitive touch screen, combinations thereof, and the like. Capacitive touch screens can include surface capacitance touch screens, projected capacitance touch screens, mutual capacitance touch screens, and self-capacitance touch screens. In implementations, thetouch screen138is configured with hardware to generate a signal to send to aprocessor150and/or driver upon detection of a touch input and/or a hover input. As indicated herein, touch inputs include inputs, gestures, and movements where the input contacts thetouch screen138.

As noted, thewatch arms120,122,124are disposed on theface104of thesmart watch100over thedisplay device118. In the embodiment shown, thesmart watch100includes an analog first watch arm (an hour hand)120, an analog second watch arm (a minute hand)122, and an analog third watch arm (a second hand or sweep hand)124coaxially mounted in theface104over thedisplay device118so that thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124rotate about a common axis ofrotation126. Thefirst watch arm120,second watch arm122, andthird watch arm124each include ashaft end120A,122A,124A, respectively, and adistal pointer end120B,122B,124B, respectively. The shaft ends120A,122A,124A, may be independently coupled to the watch arm drive128via respective,coaxial drive shafts202,204,206. As shown, theshaft end122A of the second (minute)watch arm122is coupled to, and rotated by, anoutermost shaft204; while theshaft end120A of the first watch (hour)hand120is coupled to, and rotated by, anintermediate shaft202, which extends above theoutermost shaft204; and theshaft end124A of the third watch (second or sweep)hand124is coupled to, and rotated by, aninnermost shaft206, which extends above theintermediate shaft202with respect to the surface of thedisplay device118.The watch arm drive128may drive each of theshafts202,204,206independently of one another in either the clockwise or counterclockwise directions with respect to the common axis ofrotation126. In this manner, the watch arm drive128can rotate any of thewatch arms120,122,124, either clockwise or counterclockwise, in response to commands from the watch arm control module164(FIG. 1B) to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. For example, the watch arm drive128can independently turn the respectivecoaxial drive shafts202,204,206to rotate thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124between one or more configurations to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. In embodiments, the watch arm drive128may include one or more motors and associated gear trains to independently drive (turn) each of theshafts202,204,206to rotate each of therespective watch arms120,122,124. Thus, unlike the movement of a conventional watch, in which the watch arms are driven in a clockwise direction by a single wheel (gear) train and move in a defined relationship to one another, the watch arm drive128may turn eachwatch arm120,122,124independently of theother watch arms120,122,124, either clockwise or counterclockwise.FIGS. 3A through 3Edepict theface104of thesmart watch100, wherein the analog watcharms120,122,124are rotated between example first andsecond configurations302,304,306,308,310. It will be appreciated that the illustratedconfigurations302,304,306,308,310shown inFIGS. 3A through 3E, and discussed herein, as well as any other contemplated configurations, may be considered a first configuration or a second configuration as those terms are used herein. Consequently, any of theconfigurations302,304,306,308,310can be a âfirst configurationâ from which thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any other of theconfigurations302,304,306,308,310, which may be considered a âsecond configuration.â Further, as discussed below, in any or all of the configurations shown302,304,306,308,310, any or all of thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotatable (either clockwise or counterclockwise); may be fixed (stationary) in relation to thedisplay device118andface104; or may be fixed in relation to one another but rotatable (either clockwise or counterclockwise) in relation to thedisplay device118andface104. Moreover, it is contemplated that thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any combination of positions (fixed and/or rotatable) as required to support the display of information by thedisplay device118.InFIG. 3A, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown in an example configuration (hereinafter the âtimekeeping configurationâ302), wherein thedisplay device118is configured to display awatch dial312, and thewatch arms120,122,124are rotated in relation to one another to indicate a time of day in the manner of a conventional watch or clock. Thus, in the illustratedtimekeeping configuration302, the third watch arm (second or sweep hand)124makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every sixty (60) seconds; the second watch arm (minute hand)122moves one increment of thewatch dial312each time the third watch arm (second or sweep hand)124makes one rotation of thewatch dial312and makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every sixty (60) minutes; and the first watch arm (hour hand)120moves one increment of thewatch dial312each time the second watch arm (minute hand)122makes one rotation of thewatch dial312and makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every twelve (12) hours when the watch dial is configured as a twelve (12) hour dial, or, once every twenty-four (24) hours if thewatch dial312is configured as a twenty-four (24) hour dial (e.g., complying with international standard ISO 8601).InFIGS. 3B and 3C, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown rotated toadditional example configurations304,306. In these configurations, first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124are rotated to fixed (stationary) positions314,316in relation to thedisplay device118and face104to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. In the embodiment illustrated, thefirst watch arm120is rotated to a firstfixed position314, while thesecond watch arm122and thethird watch arm124are each rotated to a secondfixed position316about the common axis ofrotation126independently of thefirst watch arm120and one another. As shown, the secondfixed position316is collinear with and opposite the firstfixed position314with respect to the axis ofrotation126. InFIG. 3B, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown oriented horizontally (hereinafter the âhorizontal fixed configurationâ304), with thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120at the nine (9) o'clock position and the pointer ends122B,124B of the second and third watcharms122,124, respectively, at the three (3) o'clock position of thewatch dial312. However, depending on the positions of thewatch arms120,122,124prior to rotation to the horizontal fixedconfiguration304, thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120can also be rotated to the three (3) o'clock position while the pointer ends122B,124B of either or both of the second and third watcharms122,124can be rotated to the nine (9) o'clock position of thewatch dial312. Similarly, inFIG. 3C, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown oriented vertically, with thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120at the six (6) o'clock position and the pointer ends122B,124B of the second and third watcharms122,124, respectively, at the twelve (12) o'clock position of the watch dial312(hereinafter the âvertical fixed configurationâ306). Again, depending on the positions of thewatch arms120,122,124prior to rotation to thesecond configuration304, thepointer end120B of thefirst watch arm120can also be rotated to the twelve (12) o'clock position while the pointer ends122B,124B of the second and third watcharms122,124, respectively, can be rotated to the six (6) o'clock position of thewatch dial312. In this manner, thewatch arms120,122,124may be quickly positioned (e.g., horizontally, at the nine (9) o'clock and three (3) o'clock positions, respectively, vertically, at the twelve (12) o'clock and six (6) o'clock positions, respectively) to support viewing of information displayed by thedisplay device118. It is contemplated that, in another configuration, thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any combination of fixed positions with respect to thedisplay device118as required to support the display of information by the display device118(e.g., thefirst watch arm120to the seven (7) o'clock and second and third watcharms122,124to the five (5) o'clock positions; thefirst watch arm120to the ten (10) o'clock and the second and third watcharms122,124to the one (1) o'clock positions; all watcharms120,122,124to the six (6) o'clock position; all watcharms120,122,124to the twelve (12) o'clock position, and so forth).InFIGS. 3D and 3E, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown inexample configurations308,310, wherein the positions of thewatch arms120,120,124are fixed with respect to one another, but can rotate with respect to thedisplay device118. InFIG. 3D, thefirst watch arm120is rotated to afirst position318, while thesecond watch arm122and thethird watch arm124are each rotated to asecond position320about the axis ofrotation126independently of thefirst watch arm120and one another. As shown, thesecond position320is collinear with and opposite thefirst position314with respect to the common axis ofrotation126. Thesecond position320is further fixed with respect to thefirst position318so that the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124form aneedle322having first and second ends322A,322B that is pivoted to rotate about the axis ofrotation126. In this configuration (hereinafter the âneedle configurationâ308), for example, thedisplay device118may be configured to display acompass rose324, while theneedle322functions as a compass needle configured to indicate a direction on the compass rose324(see the discussion ofFIG. 10). Similarly, inFIG. 3E, the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124are shown rotated about the common axis ofrotation126so that thesecond position320overlays (or underlays) the first position318(e.g., to a common position) to form apointer326. In this configuration (hereinafter the âpointer configurationâ310), thedisplay device118may be configured to display adial328, wherein thepointer326is configured to indicate a reading on thedial328.FIG. 4further illustrates operation of thebezel130. As shown, thebezel130is configured to be rotated by the user about thedisplay device118to select a mode of operation of thesmart watch100. Thebezel130may be provided withmultiple mode selections132, which are rotated by the user to aselection detent position134to select the mode of operation of thesmart watch100. In the embodiment illustrated, theselection detent position134is located above thedisplay device118as thedisplay device118is viewed by the user (at the twelve (12) o'clock position) when a watch dial is displayed by thedisplay device118. Thebezel130is provided with eight (8) mode selections: âDATEâ132A, âCALENDARâ132B, âTIME ZONEâ132C, âACTIVITYâ132D, âWEATHERâ132E, âCOMPASSâ132F, âAPPSâ132G, and âNOTIFICATIONSâ132H, which may be rotated to theselection detent position134by the user to select the mode of operation of thesmart watch100. Thus, as shown inFIG. 4, the bezel130may be sequentially rotated clockwise from the mode selection âDATEâ132A to the mode selection âCALENDARâ132B to select a calendar mode of operation of the smart watch100; from the mode selection âCALENDARâ132B to the mode selection âTIME ZONEâ132C to select a time zone mode of operation of the smart watch100; from the mode selection âTIME ZONEâ132C to the mode selection âACTIVITYâ132D to select an activity mode of operation of the smart watch100; from the mode selection âACTIVITYâ132D to the mode selection âWEATHERâ132E to select a weather mode of operation of the smart watch100; from the mode selection âWEATHERâ132E to the mode selection âCOMPASSâ132F to select a compass mode of operation of the smart watch100; from the mode selection âCOMPASSâ132F to the mode selection âAPPSâ132G to select an apps mode of operation of the smart watch100; from the mode selection âAPPSâ132G to the mode selection âNOTIFICATIONSâ132H to select a notification mode of operation of the smart watch100; and from the mode selection âNOTIFICATIONSâ132H to the mode selection âDATEâ132A to select the date mode of operation of the smart watch100. Thebezel130may also be sequentially rotated counterclockwise from the mode selection âNOTIFICATIONSâ132H to the mode selection âAPPSâ132G to select the apps mode of operation of thesmart watch100; from the mode selection âAPPSâ132G to the mode selection âCOMPASSâ132F to select the compass mode of operation of thesmart watch100; from the mode selection âCOMPASSâ132F to the mode selection âWEATHERâ132E to select the weather mode of operation of thesmart watch100, from the mode selection âWEATHERâ132E to the mode selection âACTIVITYâ132D to select the activity mode of operation of thesmart watch100; from the mode selection âACTIVITYâ132D to the mode selection âTIME ZONEâ132C to select the time zone mode of operation of thesmart watch100; from the mode selection âTIME ZONEâ132C to the mode selection âCALENDARâ132B to select the calendar mode of operation of thesmart watch100; from the mode selection âCALENDARâ132B to the mode selection âDATEâ132A to select the date mode of operation of thesmart watch100; and from the mode selection âDATEâ132A to the mode selection âNOTIFICATIONSâ132H to select the notifications mode of operation of thesmart watch100.The watch arms (e.g., thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and the third watch arm124) may be independently rotated between one or more configurations, such as the configurations shown inFIGS. 3A through 3E, depending on themode selection132chosen, and/or inputs made via thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148(or touchscreen138). For example, as shown inFIG. 4, rotating thebezel130to the mode selection âWEATHERâ132E to select the weather mode of operation of thesmart watch100may cause thedisplay device118to display a thermometer (temperature)gauge402, and the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124to be rotated about the common axis ofrotation126to thepointer configuration310thereby forming apointer326configured to indicate a temperature on thegauge402. Similarly, rotating thebezel130to the mode selection âCOMPASSâ132F to select the compass mode of operation of thesmart watch100may cause thedisplay device118to display acompass rose324, and the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124to be rotated to theneedle configuration308, thereby forming aneedle322configured to indicate a direction on thecompass rose324. Additionally, rotating thebezel130to the mode selection âAPPSâ132G to select the apps mode of operation of thesmart watch100may cause thedisplay device118to display information provided by anapplication162executed by thesmart watch100, and the first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124to be rotated to the horizontal fixedconfiguration304to permit viewing of the information displayed.In embodiments, thesmart watch100may incorporate a combination of one or more magnets and hall-effect sensors to determine a current position of thebezel130. For instance, one or more magnets may be positioned in known positions of thebezel130and one or more hall-effect sensors may be positioned in known positions of thecase102such that the magnetic field sensed by the one or moremagnetic field sensors168may be utilized to accurately determine a current position of thebezel130as thebezel130is rotated.It will be appreciated that thesmart watch100may be provided with abezel130having more orfewer mode selections132, ordifferent mode selections132than the illustrated embodiment without departing from the scope and intent of the present disclosure. Moreover, theselection detent position134may be located elsewhere in theface104of thesmart watch100, such as, for example, below, to the right, or to the left of thedisplay device118as the display device is viewed by the user (at the six (6) o'clock position, the three (3) o'clock position, or the nine (9) o'clock position, respectively, when awatch dial312is displayed by the display device118).Example FunctionalityFIGS. 5 through 21illustrate functionality provided by thesmart watch100whenvarious mode selections132are made by the user in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure. It should be understood that the functions and operations specifically shown and described herein are examples of possible functionality that may be furnished by thesmart watch100. Thus, the description of specific modes of operations and associated functionality herein should not be construed as limiting the functionality that may be provided by embodiments of thesmart watch100.FIG. 5illustrates thesmart watch100configured for timekeeping.

The present application is a continuation of, and claims priority benefit to, co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. non-provisional patent application entitled, âSMART WATCH,â application Ser. No. 15/370,915, filed Dec. 6, 2016, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. non-provisional patent application entitled, âSMART WATCH,â application Ser. No. 14/707,926, filed May 8, 2015. The above-identified applications are hereby incorporated by reference into the current application in their entirety.

Watches are portable timepieces configured to be carried or worn by a user, thus allowing the user to determine the time in a convenient manner. A wristwatch is a watch configured to be worn on a wrist of the user, and is attached to the wrist by a wrist strap such as a leather strap, plastic band, or metal bracelet. A pocket watch is a watch that is configured to be carried in a pocket of a garment worn by the user. Traditionally, watches have displayed the time using an analog display comprised of a face having a watch dial, over which a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand are disposed. Many watches also incorporate a third, rotating second hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Digital watches employ a digital display (e.g., a Light Emitting Diode (LED), a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), etc.) in place of the analog display and rotating hands.

Smart watches are watches, typically wristwatches, which furnish functionality that is enhanced beyond timekeeping. For example, some smart watches comprise wearable electronic devices that can execute applications or apps, play back digital media, and furnish Internet connectivity. Some smart watches are further equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to furnish location-based functionality. Smart watches typically employ a display device for displaying information to a user. Many smart watches further utilize touchscreens to facilitate interaction by the user with information displayed by the display device.

A smart watch is disclosed that comprises a display device over which analog rotating hands are disposed. In embodiments, the smart watch comprises a case having a face, in which a display device is disposed to display information to a user of the smart watch. Analog watch arms disposed over the display device are configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations to support the display of information by the display device. In one or more embodiments, a bezel is disposed in the face of the case around the display device. The bezel is configured to be rotated with respect to the display device to select a mode of operation of the smart watch, wherein the analog watch arms may be independently rotated between one or more configurations in response to the mode of operation selected.

Overview

Smart watches are becoming increasingly popular due to their increased functionality compared to conventional wristwatches. For example, smart watches can execute applications or apps, play back digital media, furnish cellular telephone and Internet connectivity (e.g., via a link with another device such as a smart phone), track parameter related to a user's fitness, and furnish location-based functionality such as mapping, turn by turn directions, and so forth. Smart watches typically employ a small digital display for displaying information to a user and input/output devices such as buttons and/or a touchscreens overlaying the display to facilitate interaction by the user with information displayed by the display device.

Many persons who wear wrist watches find the digital display employed by most smart watches unattractive. In response, smart watch designers have often attempted to emulate conventional watches by causing the watch's display device to display indicia mimicking the dial and watch arms of an analog watch. Nevertheless, many wristwatch wearers still prefer the appearance of analog wrist watches, which they find more aesthetically appealing. However, conventional watches employ movements that utilize a common gear (wheel) train to turn the watch arms. Thus, the motion of each of the watch arms is tied to the rotation of the other watch arms (e.g., the minute hand rotates one increment each time the second hand sweeps the dial, the hour hand rotates one increment each time the minute hand sweeps the watch dial, and so forth). Consequently, the use of conventional analog watch arms in combination with a display of a smart watch is impractical since the analog watch arms would obscure the display or limit the size and shape of the display.

Accordingly, a smart watch is disclosed that comprises a case having a face that includes a display device configured to display information to a user of the smart watch. One or more analog watch arms are disposed on the face over the display device. For example, in embodiments, an analog first watch arm (e.g., an âhour handâ) and a second analog watch arm (e.g., âminute handâ) may be disposed over the display device in the face. Additional analog watch arms may be provided. For example, an analog third watch arm (e.g., a âsecond handâ) may be disposed over the display. Watch arms may be coaxial (i.e., rotate about the same axis), non-coaxial, or both.

In accordance with the present disclosure, one or more watch arms (e.g., the first watch arm, the second watch arm, the third watch arm, etc.) are capable of independently rotating to support the display of information by the display device. For example, the watch arms may be configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations to support the display of information by the display device thereby improving the user experience. In embodiments, a watch arm drive disposed within the case may independently rotate the watch arms between one or more configurations. A bezel may be disposed in the face of the case around the display device. The bezel is configured to be rotated with respect to the display device to select a mode of operation of the smart watch. One or more of the watch arms may be independently rotated between one or more configurations by the watch arm drive in response to the mode of operation selected.

In embodiments, when the bezel is rotated to select a mode of operation that causes the smart watch to furnish timekeeping functionality, the display device may be configured to display a watch dial, and the watch arms independently rotated to a first configuration, wherein the watch arms are configured to indicate a time of day. When the watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first watch arm may, for example, be rotated to a first position, while the second watch arm is rotated to a second position about the axis independently of the first watch arm, the second position being collinear with and opposite the first position with respect to the axis of rotation. The watch arms rotate to a fixed position. In this manner, the watch arms may quickly position themselves (e.g., horizontally, at the nine (9) o'clock and three (3) o'clock positions, respectively, vertically, at the twelve (12) o'clock and six (6) o'clock positions, respectively, and so forth) to support viewing of information displayed by the display device. In other examples, when the watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first position may be fixed with respect to the second position, so that the first watch arm and second watch arm and any additional watch arms, if provided, may rotate about the axis. For example, the display device may be configured to display a compass rose, while the watch arms form a compass needle configured to indicate a direction on the compass rose. In further examples, when watch arms are rotated to a second configuration, the first watch arm may be rotated to a first position about the axis, while the second watch arm and any additional watch arms, if provided, are rotated to a second position overlaying (or underlying) the first position. Thus, the display device may be configured to display a dial, while the watch arms form a pointer configured to indicate a reading on the dial.

In the following discussion, an example smart watch employing independently rotatable watch arms is first described. Example functionality is then described that may be implemented by the smart watch in accordance with the present disclosure.

Example Environment

FIGS. 1A and 1Billustrate asmart watch100in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, thesmart watch100comprises acase102having aface104, side surfaces106, and a back (not shown). In the embodiment illustrated, thesmart watch100comprises a wristwatch designed to be worn about the wrist of a user. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that thesmart watch100may comprise a pocket watch, a pendant watch, and so forth. When configured as a wristwatch, as shown inFIG. 1A, thesmart watch100further includes awristband108that is attached to the case via pins (not shown) that engage lugs110formed in thecase102. Thewristband108comprisesstraps112,114having aclosure116such as a buckle, a deployant clasp, or the like. Thestraps112,114, may be formed of a variety of materials including, but not limited to: leather, metal (e.g., stainless steel, gold, silver, etc.), canvas, or synthetic materials such as fluoroelastomer, nylon fabric, silicone, or the like. In other embodiments, thewristband108may comprise a metal bracelet such as link bracelet, a loop bracelet, or a mesh bracelet, which may flex to permit a user to put the smart watch on his or her wrist, or may include aclosure116such as a folding clasp, a hidden clasp, or the like.

Adisplay device118is disposed in theface104of thesmart watch100to display information to the user. As shown, thedisplay device118may be generally circular (round) in shape, and may occupy substantially all of theface104of thesmart watch100. In the embodiment shown, thedisplay device118may employ an electrophoretic ink display such as an E INK display (E INK is a registered trademark of E Ink Corporation, Cambridge, Mass.) configured to display text and/or graphical information such as a graphical user interface. However, in other embodiments, thedisplay device118may comprise an LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode) display, a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD display, an LEP (Light Emitting Polymer) or PLED (Polymer Light Emitting Diode) display, and so forth. Thedisplay118may utilize ambient lighting to permit viewing of displayed information, may be backlit via a backlight such that it may be viewed in the dark or other low-light environments, may be frontlit, or may employ no light source at all.

One or more rotating analog watcharms120,122,124are disposed on theface104of thesmart watch100over thedisplay device118. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, thesmart watch100includes an analog first watch arm (e.g., an âhour handâ)120, an analog second watch arm (e.g., a âminute handâ)122, and an analog third watch arm (e.g., a âsecond handâ or âsweep handâ)124in theface104over thedisplay device118so that thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124rotate about a common axis of rotation126(seeFIG. 2). Watch arms may be coaxially mounted, non-coaxially mounted, or both. As shown, thefirst watch arm120,second watch arm122, andthird watch arm124may be independently coupled to a watch arm drive128so that thewatch arms120,122,124are capable of independently rotating to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. For example, thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124may be configured to independently rotate between one or more configurations so that information may be displayed by thedisplay device118without unnecessary obstruction by thewatch arms120,122,124. In embodiments, the watch arm drive128may independently rotate thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124between the first configuration and the second configuration. Thus, unlike the movement of a conventional watch, in which the watch arms are driven by a wheel gear train and move in a defined relationship to one another, the watch arm drive128may turn eachwatch arm120,122,124independently of theother watch arms120,122,124between the first configuration and the second configuration.

Thesmart watch100further includes abezel130disposed in theface104of thecase102around thedisplay device118. Thebezel130is configured to be rotated by the user about thedisplay device118to select a mode of operation of thesmart watch100. For example, thebezel130may be provided withmultiple mode selections132, which are rotated by the user to aselection detent position134to select the mode of operation of thesmart watch100. As discussed herein, the watch arms (e.g., thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and the third watch arm124) may be independently rotated between configurations depending on themode selection132chosen.

Awatch crystal136is provided over thewatch arms120,122,124and thedisplay device118. For example, as shown inFIG. 1A, a cavity may be formed in theface104of thecase102within thebezel130over thedisplay device118, in which thewatch arms120,122,124are disposed and rotate. Thewatch crystal136is positioned within thebezel130and encloses thedisplay device118and watcharms120,122,124within the cavity to protect thedisplay device118and watcharms120,122,124from the environment. In embodiments, the watch crystal may be formed of a suitable material such plastic, glass, mineral glass, synthetic sapphire, and so forth.

In an embodiment, thewatch crystal136can be provided with atouch screen138for entry of data and commands. In one or more implementations, thetouch screen138can be a resistive touch screen, a capacitive touch screen, combinations thereof, and the like. Capacitive touch screens can include surface capacitance touch screens, projected capacitance touch screens, mutual capacitance touch screens, and self-capacitance touch screens. In implementations, thetouch screen138is configured with hardware to generate a signal to send to aprocessor150and/or driver upon detection of a touch input and/or a hover input. As indicated herein, touch inputs include inputs, gestures, and movements where the input contacts thetouch screen138. Hover inputs include inputs, gestures, and movements where the input does not contact thetouch screen138, but is detected proximal to thetouch screen138.

Thesmart watch100further includes one or more control buttons (fivecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148are illustrated) positioned in theside surface106of thecase102. Thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148are operable to control functionality of thesmart watch100. For example, one or more of thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148may be selected (depressed) in response to information displayed by thedisplay device118to provide inputs to control operation of thesmart watch100. In embodiments, where thesmart watch100includes atouch screen138, thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148may be used in conjunction with thetouch screen138.

As shown inFIG. 1B, thesmart watch100is illustrated as including aprocessor150and amemory152. Theprocessor150provides processing functionality for thesmart watch100and can include any number of processors, micro-controllers, or other processing systems, and resident or external memory for storing data and other information accessed or generated by thesmart watch100. Theprocessor150can execute one or more software programs (e.g., an operating system (OS), a user interface (UI), applications, etc.) that implement the techniques and modules described herein. Theprocessor150is not limited by the materials from which it is formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein and, as such, can be implemented via semiconductor(s) and/or transistors (e.g., electronic integrated circuits (ICs)), and so forth.

Thememory152is an example of a tangible, non-transient device-readable storage media that provides storage functionality to store various data associated with the operation of thesmart watch100, such as the software program and code segments mentioned above, or other data to instruct theprocessor150and other elements of thesmart watch100to perform the techniques described herein. Although asingle memory152is shown, a wide variety of types and combinations of memory can be employed. Thememory152can be integral with theprocessor150, stand-alone memory, or a combination of both. Thememory152can include, for example, removable and non-removable memory elements such as RAM, ROM, Flash (e.g., SD Card, mini-SD card, micro-SD Card), magnetic, optical, USB memory devices, and so forth. In embodiments of thesmart watch100, thememory152can include removable ICC (Integrated Circuit Card) memory such as provided by SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards, USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) cards, UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Cards), and so forth.

Thesmart watch100is further illustrated as including functionality to determine and/or display position. More particularly,smart watch100can include or be coupled to a position-determiningsystem154that can manage and process signal data received from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites via aGPS receiver156. The position-determiningsystem154is representative of functionality operable to determine and/or display a geographic position through processing of the received signal data. The signal data can include various data suitable for use in position determination, such as timing signals, ranging signals, ephemerides, almanacs, and so forth.

The position-determiningsystem154can also be configured to provide a variety of other position-determining functionality. Position-determining functionality, for purposes of discussion herein, can relate to a variety of different navigation techniques and other techniques that can be supported by âknowingâ one or more positions. For instance, position-determining functionality can be employed to provide position/location information, timing information, speed information, and a variety of other navigation-related data. Accordingly, the position-determiningsystem154can be configured in a variety of ways to perform a wide variety of functions. For example, the position-determiningsystem154can be configured for outdoor navigation, vehicle navigation, aerial navigation (e.g., for airplanes, helicopters), marine navigation, personal use (e.g., as a part of fitness-related equipment), golf, and so forth. Accordingly, the position-determiningsystem154can include a variety of devices to determine position using one or more of the techniques previously described.

The position-determiningsystem154, for instance, can use signal data received via theGPS receiver156in combination with map data that is stored in thememory152or received from paired device or remote source to generate navigation instructions (e.g., turn-by-turn instructions to an input destination or POI), show a current position on a map, and so on. The position-determiningsystem154can include one or more antennas to receive signal data as well as to perform other communications, such as communication with a paired device or communication via one or more networks described in more detail below. The position-determiningsystem154can also provide other position-determining functionality, such as to determine an average speed, calculate an arrival time, determine a distance and/or direction to a target location (e.g., a pin in a hole of golf), and so on.

Although a GPS system is described and illustrated in relation toFIG. 1B, it should be apparent that a wide variety of other positioning systems can also be employed, such as other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), terrestrial based systems (e.g., wireless phone-based systems that broadcast position data from cellular towers), wireless networks that transmit positioning signals, and so on. For example, positioning-determining functionality can be implemented through the use of a server in a server-based architecture, from a ground-based infrastructure, through one or more sensors, use of âdead reckoningâ techniques, and so on.

Thesmart watch100can also include acommunication system158configured to furnish communication functionality to permit thesmart watch100to send/receive data with one or more paired devices such as a paired smart phone, or the like, and/or over one or more wireless networks.

Thesmart watch100is illustrated as employing a user interface160, which is storable in thememory152and executable by theprocessor150. The user interface160is representative of functionality to control the display of information and data to the user of thesmart watch100via thedisplay device118. The user interface160can provide functionality to allow the user to interact with one ormore applications162of thesmart watch100by providing inputs via thecontrol buttons140,142,144,146,148and/or thetouch screen138. The user interface160can cause an application programming interface (API) to be generated to expose functionality to anapplication162to configure the application for display by thedisplay device118. In embodiments, the API can further expose functionality to configure theapplication162to allow the user to interact with an application by providing inputs via thebezel130,control buttons140,142,144,146,148, and/or thetouchscreen138.Applications162, which may include applications, mobile applications (mobile apps), and so forth, comprise software, which is storable inmemory152and executable by theprocessor150, to perform a specific operation or group of operations to furnish functionality to thesmart watch100.Applications162can include browser applications, cellular telephone applications, instant messaging applications, email applications, photograph sharing applications, calendar applications, address book applications, media player applications, fitness/health monitoring applications, sport related applications, navigation related applications, combinations thereof, and so forth.Example applications162are described in the discussion ofFIGS. 13A through 19C.

In embodiments, the user interface160may further include a browser. The browser enables thesmart watch100to display and interact with content such as a webpage within the World Wide Web, a webpage provided by a web server in a private network, and so forth. In some embodiments, the browser may be implemented as anapplication162that may be stored in memory and executed by theprocessor150.

Thesmart watch100is illustrated as including a watcharm control module164, which is storable inmemory152and executable by theprocessor150. The watcharm control module164represents functionality to furnish control of the watch arm drive128to independently turn thewatch arms120,122,124as described herein below with respect toFIGS. 2 and 3A through 3E. The functionality represented by the watcharm control module164may thus be employed in concert with functionality provided by the user interface160andapplications162to support the display of information to the user of thesmart watch100via thedisplay device118. The watcharm control module164may receive inputs from thebezel130,control buttons140,142,144,146,148, and/or thetouch screen138, for example, via the user interface160. The watcharm control module164may then cause the watch arm drive128to turn thewatch arms120,122,124in a manner indicated by the inputs made.

Thesmart watch100is further illustrated as including amotion sensor166that detects motion (movement) of thesmart watch100. In embodiments, themotion sensor166can comprise an accelerometer to detect proper acceleration of thesmart watch100from which the motion of thesmart watch100may be determined. Thesmart watch100may further include amagnetic field sensor168that may enable the accurate determination of a direction by sensing the electromagnetic field of the Earth.

In embodiments, thesmart watch100can further be equipped with aperformance monitoring component170. Theperformance monitoring component170may be positioned within thecase102or may be coupled to the smart watch via thecommunication system158. Theperformance monitoring component170may receive information, including, but not limited to geographic location information, from theposition determining system154, to perform a function, such as monitoring performance and/or calculating performance values and/or information related to the user's movement (e.g., exercise). The monitoring of the performance and/or the calculating performance values may be based at least in part on the geographic location information. The performance values may include, for example, a user's heart rate, speed, a total distance traveled, total distance goals, speed goals, pace, cadence, and calories burned. These values and/or information may be employed by thesmart watch100, for example, when thesmart watch100is in the activity mode of operation, and/or by one ormore applications162when thesmart watch100is in the app mode of operation.

Thesmart watch100may further include aspeaker172configured to furnish audible alerts (such as beeps, ringtones). In embodiments, thespeaker172may further be capable of furnishing playback of media, voice communications, and so forth.

FIG. 2further illustrates operation of the analog watcharms120,122,124by the watch arm drive128in an example embodiment of thesmart watch100. As noted, thewatch arms120,122,124are disposed on theface104of thesmart watch100over thedisplay device118. In the embodiment shown, thesmart watch100includes an analog first watch arm (an hour hand)120, an analog second watch arm (a minute hand)122, and an analog third watch arm (a second hand or sweep hand)124coaxially mounted in theface104over thedisplay device118so that thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124rotate about a common axis ofrotation126. Thefirst watch arm120,second watch arm122, andthird watch arm124each include ashaft end120A,122A,124A, respectively, and adistal pointer end120B,122B,124B, respectively. The shaft ends120A,122A,124A, may be independently coupled to the watch arm drive128via respective,coaxial drive shafts202,204,206. As shown, theshaft end122A of the second (minute)watch arm122is coupled to, and rotated by, anoutermost shaft204; while theshaft end120A of the first watch (hour)hand120is coupled to, and rotated by, anintermediate shaft202, which extends above theoutermost shaft204; and theshaft end124A of the third watch (second or sweep)hand124is coupled to, and rotated by, aninnermost shaft206, which extends above theintermediate shaft202with respect to the surface of thedisplay device118.

The watch arm drive128may drive each of theshafts202,204,206independently of one another in either the clockwise or counterclockwise directions with respect to the common axis ofrotation126. In this manner, the watch arm drive128can rotate any of thewatch arms120,122,124, either clockwise or counterclockwise, in response to commands from the watch arm control module164(FIG. 1B) to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. For example, the watch arm drive128can independently turn the respectivecoaxial drive shafts202,204,206to rotate thefirst watch arm120, thesecond watch arm122, and thethird watch arm124between one or more configurations to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. In embodiments, the watch arm drive128may include one or more motors and associated gear trains to independently drive (turn) each of theshafts202,204,206to rotate each of therespective watch arms120,122,124. Thus, unlike the movement of a conventional watch, in which the watch arms are driven in a clockwise direction by a single wheel (gear) train and move in a defined relationship to one another, the watch arm drive128may turn eachwatch arm120,122,124independently of theother watch arms120,122,124, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

FIGS. 3A through 3Edepict theface104of thesmart watch100, wherein the analog watcharms120,122,124are rotated between example first andsecond configurations302,304,306,308,310. It will be appreciated that the illustratedconfigurations302,304,306,308,310shown inFIGS. 3A through 3E, and discussed herein, as well as any other contemplated configurations, may be considered a first configuration or a second configuration as those terms are used herein. Consequently, any of theconfigurations302,304,306,308,310can be a âfirst configurationâ from which thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any other of theconfigurations302,304,306,308,310, which may be considered a âsecond configuration.â Further, as discussed below, in any or all of the configurations shown302,304,306,308,310, any or all of thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotatable (either clockwise or counterclockwise); may be fixed (stationary) in relation to thedisplay device118andface104; or may be fixed in relation to one another but rotatable (either clockwise or counterclockwise) in relation to thedisplay device118andface104. Moreover, it is contemplated that thewatch arms120,122,124may be rotated to any combination of positions (fixed and/or rotatable) as required to support the display of information by thedisplay device118.

InFIG. 3A, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown in an example configuration (hereinafter the âtimekeeping configurationâ302), wherein thedisplay device118is configured to display awatch dial312, and thewatch arms120,122,124are rotated in relation to one another to indicate a time of day in the manner of a conventional watch or clock. Thus, in the illustratedtimekeeping configuration302, the third watch arm (second or sweep hand)124makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every sixty (60) seconds; the second watch arm (minute hand)122moves one increment of thewatch dial312each time the third watch arm (second or sweep hand)124makes one rotation of thewatch dial312and makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every sixty (60) minutes; and the first watch arm (hour hand)120moves one increment of thewatch dial312each time the second watch arm (minute hand)122makes one rotation of thewatch dial312and makes one complete rotation about thewatch dial312every twelve (12) hours when the watch dial is configured as a twelve (12) hour dial, or, once every twenty-four (24) hours if thewatch dial312is configured as a twenty-four (24) hour dial (e.g., complying with international standard ISO 8601).

InFIGS. 3B and 3C, thewatch arms120,122,124are shown rotated toadditional example configurations304,306. In these configurations, first, second, and third watcharms120,122,124are rotated to fixed (stationary) positions314,316in relation to thedisplay device118and face104to support the display of information by thedisplay device118. In the embodiment illustrated, thefirst watch arm120is rotated to a firstfixed position314, while thesecond watch arm122and thethird watch arm124are each rotated to a secondfixed position316about the common axis ofrotation126independently of thefirst watch arm120and one another. As shown, the secondfixed position316is collinear with and opposite the firstfixed position314with respect to the axis ofrotation126.
