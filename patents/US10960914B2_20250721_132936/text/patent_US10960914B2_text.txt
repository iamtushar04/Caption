Snowbike2includes a dirt bike4having the front and rear wheels removed. Snowbike2includes aframe6, apowertrain8, aseat10,steering assembly12includinghandlebars14, and afront suspension15. Front suspension is in part defined by the existing front forkassembly having forks18, designated asleft front fork18L andright front fork18R. Afront fender20is positioned between thefront forks18. As shown, front wheel is removed and replaced with afront ski mount28which couple to theforks18as discussed herein. The rear wheel is removed and includes arear suspension30, including atunnel32and atrack34.Rear suspension30could be similar to any of the rear suspensions shown in our US patents and applications, namely: U.S. Pat. No. 8,910,738; Publications 2012/0222908; 2015/0144412; 2015/0259032; 2016/0280331 and application Ser. No. 14/935,224; Ser. No. 14/935,265 and Ser. No. 15/165,862; the subject matter of which are incorporated herein by reference.With reference now toFIGS. 2-4,front suspension15is shown comprising the forks orlegs18L and18R which are coupled toski mount28, which in turn is coupled tofront ski40. It should be understood thatleft leg18L andright leg18R are coupled to theframe6of the snow bike by way of atriple clamp42having a lowerleft clamp portion44L and a lower righthand clamp portion44R; and an upperleft clamp portion46L and an upperright clamp portion46R. These clamp portions clamp to associatedlegs18L and18R as is known in the art.Triple clamp42also includes acenter pin48which may couple to a down tube (not shown) of theframe6, such thatlegs18L and18R may rotate aboutpin48for steering. As shown inFIGS. 2-4, lower ends of thelegs18L and18R are coupled to theski mount28in order to turn theski40for purposes of steering. As also shown,front suspension15further includes alinear force element49which is coupled between a bottom oftriple clamp42and a top of theski mount28, as further described herein.With reference now toFIGS. 5-8, theski mount28will be described in greater detail. With reference first toFIG. 5A,ski mount28includes aspindle50having spaced apartplate portions52. Theplate portions52are spaced apart by way of a box-shapedinner plate54and apin56. Abracket60has abase portion62coupled betweenplates52and includes aclevis64having apertures at66. Upper ends ofplates52include apertures at70and lower ends ofplate52includeapertures72.As shown inFIG. 5,brackets76are coupled to a top of theplates52by way offasteners78extending throughapertures80ofbracket76and into threaded engagement with threaded apertures70(FIG. 5A).Brackets76retainclamps86by way offasteners88and90which couple to ends oflegs18L and18R as best shown inFIG. 2.Brackets76could be integrated withplate portions52which would extend from an upper edge of theplate portions52.Alower coupler100is coupled to apertures72(FIG. 5A) by way offasteners102,104and106.Fasteners102extend throughapertures110ofcoupler100.Coupler100is also coupled toski40and in particular, to amount portion120ofski40whereski mount120includes up standingwalls122havingapertures124.Coupler100includes an aperture at130which receives asleeve132which thereupon receivesbushings134, thereover. As shown best inFIG. 8,bushings134overlap sleeve132andsleeves138extend into aperture124(FIG. 5of ski mount120).Spacers136extend between heads of thebushings134,138.Fastener140is received throughwasher142throughaperture124and through a combination ofbushings138,136,134andsleeve130to receivefasteners150and152.Fasteners140,150and152couple theski40to thecoupler100. Arubber mount160is positioned in theski mount120and conforms to, but allows movement between,coupler100andski40as best shown inFIG. 6.Finally, as shown inFIG. 5,suspension15includesbracket170having aclevis172.Bracket170is mounted to a bottom of thetriple clamp42throughapertures174. As shown best inFIG. 7,bracket170traps fender20betweentriple clamp42andbracket170. Thus, as shown inFIG. 5,linear force element49is coupled to thesnow bike2by way offastener176extending throughaperture180oflinear force element49and throughclevis172; and by way offastener182extending throughaperture178oflinear force element49and through clevis64(FIG. 5A). Thus,linear force element49supplements the existing shocks in thefront legs18L and18R.With reference now toFIGS. 9-11, the operation of thefront suspension15will now be described in greater detail. As shown,suspension15is shown in the fully collapsed state where both the shock absorbers of thefront forks18L,18R andlinear force element49are shown in a fully compressed state. As shown,linear force element49is an air shock available from Fox Shox and has the same linear travel as themotor bike forks18L,18R; a range of 8 to 14â³, preferably 10 to 12â³. In the embodiment shown the linear travel is 11â³. In the embodiment shown,linear force element49is an EVOL Series Float shock available from Fox Shox located at 915 Disc Dr., Scotts Valley, Calif. 95066. This shock is an air shock with a progressive rate which progressive range is adjustable.While theLFE49is shown herein as an air shock, other linear force elements are possible. For example, the linear force element could be a gas shock or a shock with a spring over, similar to that described in our U.S. Pat. No. 8,079,602. The linear force element could also be a hydraulic shock, or a spring or a series of springs. These components could have a linear or progressive rate which rate is adjustable. In addition, linear force element could be a linkage coupled between the triple clamp and the ski, a linkage similar to that described in our US Patent as the coupled suspension system. In that way, the stroke of the shock could be tuned to vary from the stroke of thefront forks18L and18R.Linear force element49works in combination with the motor bike shocks withinforks18L,18R to give the front forks the proper spring rate and damping force for the snow bike. In the embodiment shown,linear force element49is also in compression the entire time; that is between the positions shown in2-4and9-11.It should be appreciated that thespindle50could be comprised of an integrated unit where the all of the components are fixed to each other, namelyspindle50,brackets76, the inner portions ofbrackets86andcoupler100. This could be assembled by such means as welding or adhesives for example. The integrated spindle could also be a forging or casting which is in a homogenous state.It should also be appreciated that a lower end of theLFE49could be attached to a modifiedcoupler100. As shown inFIG. 12, acoupler200is shown at200, which is identical tocoupler100, yet it includes a notch at202to receive a lower end ofLFE49. In this manner,fastener102couples both thecoupler200and theLFE49, asfastener102extends through aperture178(FIG. 5) ofLFE49.In the above described embodiment, the ski mounts28andlinear force element49are designed as a kit for converting a motorbike to a snow bike having existing shocks positioned in the front forks, or for retrofitting existing snow bikes. In the case where a new snow bike front suspension is desired, the front suspension could includefront forks18L and18R, but in this case, the front forks would not include internal shocks, but rather would only be struts which allow linear telescopic movement but would not have any internal dampening resistance. While this design would include alinear force element49, the spring rate of the combinedsuspension15would still be consistent with that disclosed above.While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains.

Snowbike2includes aframe6, apowertrain8, aseat10,steering assembly12includinghandlebars14, and afront suspension15. Front suspension is in part defined by the existing front forkassembly having forks18, designated asleft front fork18L andright front fork18R. Afront fender20is positioned between thefront forks18. As shown, front wheel is removed and replaced with afront ski mount28which couple to theforks18as discussed herein. The rear wheel is removed and includes arear suspension30, including atunnel32and atrack34.Rear suspension30could be similar to any of the rear suspensions shown in our US patents and applications, namely: U.S. Pat. No. 8,910,738; Publications 2012/0222908; 2015/0144412; 2015/0259032; 2016/0280331 and application Ser. No. 14/935,224; Ser. No. 14/935,265 and Ser. No. 15/165,862; the subject matter of which are incorporated herein by reference.

With reference now toFIGS. 2-4,front suspension15is shown comprising the forks orlegs18L and18R which are coupled toski mount28, which in turn is coupled tofront ski40. It should be understood thatleft leg18L andright leg18R are coupled to theframe6of the snow bike by way of atriple clamp42having a lowerleft clamp portion44L and a lower righthand clamp portion44R; and an upperleft clamp portion46L and an upperright clamp portion46R. These clamp portions clamp to associatedlegs18L and18R as is known in the art.Triple clamp42also includes acenter pin48which may couple to a down tube (not shown) of theframe6, such thatlegs18L and18R may rotate aboutpin48for steering. As shown inFIGS. 2-4, lower ends of thelegs18L and18R are coupled to theski mount28in order to turn theski40for purposes of steering. As also shown,front suspension15further includes alinear force element49which is coupled between a bottom oftriple clamp42and a top of theski mount28, as further described herein.

With reference now toFIGS. 5-8, theski mount28will be described in greater detail. With reference first toFIG. 5A,ski mount28includes aspindle50having spaced apartplate portions52. Theplate portions52are spaced apart by way of a box-shapedinner plate54and apin56. Abracket60has abase portion62coupled betweenplates52and includes aclevis64having apertures at66. Upper ends ofplates52include apertures at70and lower ends ofplate52includeapertures72.

As shown inFIG. 5,brackets76are coupled to a top of theplates52by way offasteners78extending throughapertures80ofbracket76and into threaded engagement with threaded apertures70(FIG. 5A).Brackets76retainclamps86by way offasteners88and90which couple to ends oflegs18L and18R as best shown inFIG. 2.Brackets76could be integrated withplate portions52which would extend from an upper edge of theplate portions52.

Alower coupler100is coupled to apertures72(FIG. 5A) by way offasteners102,104and106.Fasteners102extend throughapertures110ofcoupler100.Coupler100is also coupled toski40and in particular, to amount portion120ofski40whereski mount120includes up standingwalls122havingapertures124.Coupler100includes an aperture at130which receives asleeve132which thereupon receivesbushings134, thereover. As shown best inFIG. 8,bushings134overlap sleeve132andsleeves138extend into aperture124(FIG. 5of ski mount120).Spacers136extend between heads of thebushings134,138.Fastener140is received throughwasher142throughaperture124and through a combination ofbushings138,136,134andsleeve130to receivefasteners150and152.Fasteners140,150and152couple theski40to thecoupler100. Arubber mount160is positioned in theski mount120and conforms to, but allows movement between,coupler100andski40as best shown inFIG. 6.

Finally, as shown inFIG. 5,suspension15includesbracket170having aclevis172.Bracket170is mounted to a bottom of thetriple clamp42throughapertures174. As shown best inFIG. 7,bracket170traps fender20betweentriple clamp42andbracket170. Thus, as shown inFIG. 5,linear force element49is coupled to thesnow bike2by way offastener176extending throughaperture180oflinear force element49and throughclevis172; and by way offastener182extending throughaperture178oflinear force element49and through clevis64(FIG. 5A). Thus,linear force element49supplements the existing shocks in thefront legs18L and18R.

With reference now toFIGS. 9-11, the operation of thefront suspension15will now be described in greater detail. As shown,suspension15is shown in the fully collapsed state where both the shock absorbers of thefront forks18L,18R andlinear force element49are shown in a fully compressed state. As shown,linear force element49is an air shock available from Fox Shox and has the same linear travel as themotor bike forks18L,18R; a range of 8 to 14â³, preferably 10 to 12â³. In the embodiment shown the linear travel is 11â³. In the embodiment shown,linear force element49is an EVOL Series Float shock available from Fox Shox located at 915 Disc Dr., Scotts Valley, Calif. 95066. This shock is an air shock with a progressive rate which progressive range is adjustable.

While theLFE49is shown herein as an air shock, other linear force elements are possible. For example, the linear force element could be a gas shock or a shock with a spring over, similar to that described in our U.S. Pat. No. 8,079,602. The linear force element could also be a hydraulic shock, or a spring or a series of springs. These components could have a linear or progressive rate which rate is adjustable. In addition, linear force element could be a linkage coupled between the triple clamp and the ski, a linkage similar to that described in our US Patent as the coupled suspension system. In that way, the stroke of the shock could be tuned to vary from the stroke of thefront forks18L and18R.

Linear force element49works in combination with the motor bike shocks withinforks18L,18R to give the front forks the proper spring rate and damping force for the snow bike. In the embodiment shown,linear force element49is also in compression the entire time; that is between the positions shown in2-4and9-11.

It should be appreciated that thespindle50could be comprised of an integrated unit where the all of the components are fixed to each other, namelyspindle50,brackets76, the inner portions ofbrackets86andcoupler100. This could be assembled by such means as welding or adhesives for example. The integrated spindle could also be a forging or casting which is in a homogenous state.

It should also be appreciated that a lower end of theLFE49could be attached to a modifiedcoupler100. As shown inFIG. 12, acoupler200is shown at200, which is identical tocoupler100, yet it includes a notch at202to receive a lower end ofLFE49. In this manner,fastener102couples both thecoupler200and theLFE49, asfastener102extends through aperture178(FIG. 5) ofLFE49.

In the above described embodiment, the ski mounts28andlinear force element49are designed as a kit for converting a motorbike to a snow bike having existing shocks positioned in the front forks, or for retrofitting existing snow bikes. In the case where a new snow bike front suspension is desired, the front suspension could includefront forks18L and18R, but in this case, the front forks would not include internal shocks, but rather would only be struts which allow linear telescopic movement but would not have any internal dampening resistance. While this design would include alinear force element49, the spring rate of the combinedsuspension15would still be consistent with that disclosed above.

While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains.
