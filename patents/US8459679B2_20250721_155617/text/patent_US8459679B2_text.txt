DESCRIPTION:
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/227,402, filed Jul. 21, 2009, the specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.TECHNICAL FIELDThe invention relates generally to scooters, tricycles and the like and, more particularly, to an improved pivot mechanism for scooters, tricycles and the like configured to improved their use and functionality.BACKGROUNDScooters and tricycles are among the most popular items for children. Although many developments have improved the original design of these items, conventional designs continue to have shortcomings that manufacturers strive to improve upon. In regard to scooters, many conventional scooter designs allow the scooter to fold so as to facilitate storage, packaging, etc. To this end, many designs call for a fold mechanism that allows the steering assembly to fold over the deck of the scooter. These designs may further include various lock mechanisms that lock the steering assembly in a ready-to-use position and in a storage position.Conventional fold mechanism designs, however, have some drawbacks. By way of example, the fold mechanisms are generally complex in their design and as a result, may be expensive and difficult to manufacture. Additionally, some fold mechanism designs are generally open so as to expose sharp edges and/or moving parts to the user. Such designs are generally undesirable and may present some safety concerns, such as, for example, providing a potential pinch point for the user.In regard to tricycles, there are several versions or types of tricycles that are offered to today's consumers. For example, one type of tricycle is a conventional tricycle design wherein the front wheel is positioned substantially underneath the handlebar and the saddle is located relatively high on the frame. Such a conventional tricycle design is referred to herein as a high rider. Another type of tricycle, however, has a chopper design wherein the front wheel is located forward of the handlebar and the saddle is positioned relatively low on the frame. Such a modified tricycle is referred to herein as a low rider.Conventionally, if a child desired both types of tricycle, his or her parents had to purchase two separate tricycles, each having the desired configuration. However, in some instances, convertible tricycles have been made available capable of converting between the conventional high rider configuration and a low rider configuration. In this regard, these convertible devices typically include costly, relatively complex mechanisms for converting between the two configurations. Additionally, these mechanisms may include exposed parts or surfaces that present relatively sharp edges, provide potential pinch points, and/or pose other safety concerns to the user of the convertible tricycle.Thus, while conventional scooters and tricycles are generally successful for their intended purpose, there remains a need for improved designs that address these and other shortcomings in conventional construction.SUMMARYA pivot mechanism includes a base member configured to be coupled to a first element and a generally cylindrical rotating member configured to be coupled to a second element. The base member includes a bottom wall, a pair of opposed side walls, and a pair of opposed end walls that collectively define a cavity. At least one of the end walls has a first aperture therethrough. The rotating member includes a side wall and a pair of opposed end walls and is at least partially positioned within the cavity of the base member. At least one of the end walls has a second aperture therethrough. An elongate pin extends through the first and second apertures in the base member and rotating member and defines a pivot axis. The rotating member is capable of rotating relative to the base member about the pivot axis to provide relative movement between the first and second elements. The elongate pin is movable in a direction generally parallel to the pivot axis between a secured position and a release position. In the secured position, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member. In the release position, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member.A locking mechanism prevents rotation of the rotating member relative to the base member when the pin is in the secured position. In one embodiment, the locking mechanism includes at least one key on the pin and at least one keyway on the base member. When the key engages the keyway, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member and when the key disengages the keyway, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member. The pin may be biased, such as by a spring, toward the secured position.The pivot mechanism may be incorporated in a wide range of child vehicles. In one embodiment, for example, the pivot mechanism may be incorporated in a scooter. The scooter includes a first frame portion having a deck and a rear wheel and a second frame portion having a steering assembly with a front wheel and a handlebar. The pivot mechanism couples the first and second frame portions to provide pivotal movement therebetween. In this regard, the pivot mechanism defines a ready-to-use position of the scooter and a folded position of the scooter. In another embodiment, the pivot mechanism may be incorporated into a tricycle. The tricycle includes a first frame portion having a steering assembly with a front wheel and a handlebar and a second frame portion having a pair or rear wheels. The pivot mechanism couples the first and second frame portions to provide pivotal movement therebetween. For example, the pivot mechanism defines a high rider configuration and a low rider configuration of the tricycle. The pivot mechanism may also define a storage configuration of the tricycle.A method of pivoting a first frame portion relative to a second frame portion includes moving a push pin in a first direction generally parallel to the pin to disengage a key from a keyway; rotating a rotating member relative to the base member when they key and keyway are disengaged; and moving the push pin in a second direction generally parallel to the pin to engage the key with the keyway and lock the relative positions of the first and second frame portions.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with a general description of the invention given above, and the detailed description given below, serve to explain the invention.FIG. 1is a perspective view of a pivot mechanism in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention;FIG. 2is a perspective exploded view of the pivot mechanism illustrated inFIG. 1;FIG. 3is a side elevation view of a scooter having a pivot mechanism in accordance with one embodiment of the invention and with the steering assembly in an upright, ready-to-use position;FIG. 4is a side elevation view of the scooter shown inFIG. 3, but with the steering assembly in a folded position;FIG. 5is a side elevation view of a scooter having a pivot mechanism in accordance with another embodiment of the invention and with the steering assembly in an upright, ready-to-use position;FIG. 6is a side elevation view of the scooter shown inFIG. 5, but with the steering assembly in a folded position;FIG. 7is a side elevation view of a tricycle having a pivot mechanism in accordance with one embodiment of the invention and with the tricycle in a high-rider configuration;FIG. 8is a side elevation view of the tricycle shown inFIG. 7, but in a low rider configuration; andFIG. 9is a side elevation view of the tricycle shown inFIG. 7, but in a storage configuration.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONReferring now to the drawings and toFIGS. 1 and 2in particular, apivot mechanism10in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown. Thepivot mechanism10is configured to allow afirst element12to rotate relative to asecond element14. Thepivot mechanism10includes abase member16configured to be secured to one of the first orsecond element12,14, and a rotatingmember18rotatably mounted tobase member16and secured to the other of the first orsecond element12,14. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, thepivot mechanism10has a generally closed configuration to reduce or eliminate sharp edges and exposed parts.In one embodiment, thebase member16includes a generally planarbottom wall20, a pair ofopposed side walls22,24, and a pair ofopposed end walls26,28. Thebottom wall20may be configured to be secured to thefirst element12, such as through welding, adhesives, fasteners, or other suitable means. In one embodiment, theside walls22,24do not extend for a full height of thepivot mechanism10, but extend for only a portion of the height. The height of theside walls22,24may vary depending on the particular application. For example, the height of theside walls22,24may be determined by the desired angle through which thesecond element14is configured to move during the pivoting motion. Each of theend walls26,28includes alower portion30and anupper portion32. Thelower portion30is configured to meet theside walls22,24at edges thereof. Theupper portion32, however, is configured to extend above theside walls22,24. In one exemplary embodiment, theupper portion32ofend walls26,28may define a generallyarcuate surface34. For example, in one embodiment thearcuate surface34may be a circular arc. Other arcuate shapes, however, may also be possible. As shown inFIG. 2, thebase member16, and more particularly the walls thereof, defines a cradle that, in turn, generally defines acavity36configured to receive and support the rotatingmember18therein, as explained in more detail below.The rotatingmember18may be generally positioned within thecavity36defined bybase member16and includes a generally cylindrical configuration, as illustrated inFIG. 2. The rotatingmember18includes aside wall38andopposed end walls40,42. Theside wall38may be configured to be secured to thesecond element14, such as through welding, adhesives, fasteners, or other suitable means. When the rotatingmember18is positioned withincavity36, theend walls40,42may be adjacent theend walls26,28of the base member16(e.g., may abut or be slightly spaced therefrom). Additionally, theouter surface44ofside wall38may be generally flush with thearcuate surface34defined by theend walls26,28. Such a configuration provides a relatively smooth and contoured look to pivotmechanism10.To provide the pivotal relation between the first andsecond elements12,14, the rotatingmember18is pivotally or rotatably mounted relative to thebase member16. In this regard,pivot mechanism10includes a generallyelongate push pin46adapted to rotatably mount the rotatingmember18tobase member16and define apivot axis48about which the rotating member18(and thus the second element14) rotates. For reasons that will become clearer below, thepush pin46has a generally cylindrical configuration and includes aninner body portion50having a first cross dimension (e.g., diameter) and anouter body portion52having a second cross dimension less than the first cross dimension to define ashoulder54therebetween. The outer end ofouter body portion52generally defines apush button56.In one embodiment, thepush pin46may be configured to extend along the centerline of the generally cylindrical rotatingmember18. To this end, at least one ofend walls40,42, and preferably both ofend walls40,42, includes acentral aperture58configured to receivepush pin46. Thecentral aperture58may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46, therein. To secure the rotatingmember18to thebase member16, at least one of theend walls26,28ofbase member16also includes acentral aperture60configured to receivepush pin46. In a similar manner as described above, thecentral aperture60may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and may be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46, therein. When thepush pin46is disposed through thecentral apertures58,60of thebase member16and the rotatingmember18, the only relative motion permitted therebetween is rotation abovepivot axis48.To secure thepush pin46in place within thebase member16and rotatingmember18, thepivot mechanism10may include a pair ofcover plates62,64secured to the outer surface ofend walls26,28, respectively. By way of example, and in one embodiment, thecover plates62,64and endwalls26,28may include threadedbores66configured to receive a threadedfastener68to secure thecover plates62,64thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other suitable fasteners to secure thecover plates62,64to theend walls26,28ofbase member16. In one embodiment, thecover plates62,64may be generally circular in shape. Thus, for example, at least a portion of the outer edge ofcover plates62,64may be generally flush with thearcuate surface34defined by theend walls26,28. Again, such a configuration provides a relatively smooth and contoured look to pivotmechanism10.As shown inFIG. 2,cover plate62includes acentral aperture70adapted to receive thepush pin46. Thecentral aperture70may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theouter body portion52ofpush pin46, therein. Moreover, the size ofcentral aperture70is such that, while capable of receiving theouter body portion52therein,central aperture70is smaller than theinner body portion50ofpush pin46. In this way, theinner body portion50is too large to extend throughcentral aperture70. Accordingly, once thepush pin46is in place and thecover plate62is secured to thebase member16, thepush pin46is not capable of being removed from thecentral apertures58,60ofbase member16and rotatingmember18.In regard to coverplate64, in one embodiment,cover plate64includes ablind bore72, as shown inFIG. 2. The blind bore72may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snuggly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, an end of theouter body portion52. The blind bore72is closed off by a solid wall and thus, thepush pin46will not be able to be removed fromcentral apertures58,60ofbase member16and rotatingmember18by moving thepush pin46alongpivot axis48and towardcover plate64.In one aspect in accordance with the invention, in addition to providing thepivot axis48forpivot mechanism10, thepush pin46also provides at least in part a locking mechanism for securing thesecond element14in at least one, and preferably a plurality of positions, relative to thefirst element12. In this regard, the locking mechanism includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of projections orkeys74onpush pin46that cooperate with at least one, and preferably a plurality of recesses or keyways76formed in thebase member16and rotatingmember18. Whenkeys74engage certain keyways76, rotating member18(and thus second element14) is prevented from rotating relative to base member16(and thus first element12). However, whenkeys74disengage certain keyways76, rotatingmember18may be rotated relative tobase member16.As shown in more detail inFIG. 2,push pin46includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of,keys74projecting radially therefrom. As shown in this figure, thekeys74project from theinner body portion50and extend in a direction generally parallel to thepivot axis48and beginning at theshoulder54. In one embodiment, thekeys74extend for only a portion of the length of theinner body portion50. However, the length is sufficient to permit proper operation of the locking mechanism as explained in more detail below. Thekeys74are configured to cooperate with keyways76formed in thebase member16and rotatingmember18. To this end, and as illustrated inFIG. 2,end wall26ofbase member16includes at least one, and preferably a plurality ofkeyways76aconfigured to engage thekeys74. In one embodiment, thekeyways76amay be configured as recesses or notches that are open tocentral aperture60and extend radially outward therefrom. Similarly,end wall40of rotatingmember18includes at least one, and preferably a plurality ofkeyways76bconfigured to engage thekeys74. In one embodiment, thekeyways76bmay be configured as recesses or notches that are open tocentral aperture58and extend radially outward therefrom.Operation of the locking mechanism will now be described. As an initial matter, it should be realized that thepush pin46is movable in a direction generally parallel to thepivot axis48between a first, secured position, wherein the first andsecond elements12,14are fixed relative to each other (e.g., the rotatingmember18is not permitted to rotate relative to base member16), and a release position, wherein the first andsecond elements12,14are movable relative to each other (e.g., the rotatingmember18is permitted to rotate relative to the base member16). As illustrated inFIG. 2, thepush pin46may be spring biased. More particularly,push pin46may be spring biased in a direction parallel to thepivot axis48and in a direction towardcover plate62. To this end,pivot mechanism10may include aspring78having one end configured to engage thepush pin46, such as adjacent aninner end80thereof, and another end configured to engage thecover plate64. In one embodiment, for example, the other end of thespring78may be configured to engage the solid wall of blind bore72formed incover plate64. As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, other arrangements are also possible to provide a biasing force to pushpin46in a preferred direction. It should be noted that even though thepush pin46is spring biased, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46remains too large to extend into theaperture70ofcover plate62.In an exemplary embodiment, thespring78biases thepush pin46toward the secured position. In the secured position, thekeys74engage thekeyways76ainend wall26ofbase member16and also engage thekeyways76bin theend wall40of rotatingmember18. Because thekeys74engage bothkeyways76a,76b, the rotatingmember18is prevented from rotating relative tobase member16. Moreover, as illustrated inFIG. 1, in the secured position, thepush button56projects throughcentral aperture70incover plate62and slightly beyond anouter surface82thereof. This allows a user to depress thepush button56inwardly and move thepush pin46toward the release position.As thepush pin46is being depressed inwardly against the bias fromspring78, thekeys74move in a direction parallel to thepivot axis48so as to disengage thekeyways76ain theend wall26ofbase member16. In other words, thekeys74are positioned inwardly ofend wall26such that rotation of rotatingmember18is now permitted relative tobase member16. As rotation begins, in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the end surfaces84ofkeys74engage theinner wall surface86ofend wall26. Thus, the user may stop pressingpush button56and thepush pin46will remain in the release position. Thepush pin46remains in the release position as the rotatingmember18is turned until thenext keyway76ain theend wall26is reached. When thenext keyway76ais reached, the bias ofspring78causes thepush pin46to move outwardly toward the secured position so thatkeys74re-engage keyways76ainbase member16to once again prevent the rotation of rotatingmember18relative tobase member16. When thepush pin46is depressed, thekeys74, while configured to disengage thekeyways76a, should not disengage thekeyways76bin theend wall40of rotatingmember18. In this regard, when thepush pin46is fully depressed, the inner end ofpush pin46may contact the bottom solid wall of blind bore72to prevent thekeys74from disengagingkeyways76b.The number ofkeys74and keyways76may vary depending on the application and the number of positions in which it is desired to fix the relative positions of the first andsecond elements12,14. For example, it is contemplated that in most applications, thepush pin46may include only one or twokeys74. Of course,more keys74are possible should it be necessary to meet the needs or desires of a particular application. The number ofkeyways76ainend wall26ofbase member16generally corresponds to the number of desired fixed positions between the first andsecond elements12,14. For example, it is contemplated that in most applications, theend wall26may be configured to secure one, two or three different relative positions of first andsecond elements12,14. Of course, more keyways and fixed positions are possible should it be necessary to meet the needs or desires of a particular application.Thepivot mechanism10as described above may be incorporated into a wide range of items including without limitation, scooters, tricycles, bicycles, and other pedaled or non-pedaled vehicles. For example, as shown inFIGS. 3 and 4,pivot mechanism10may be incorporated into ascooter100to allow a first portion of thescooter100to fold relative to a second portion of thescooter100. As previously discussed, while folding scooters are generally known in the art, the various mechanisms that permit the folding have drawbacks addressed bypivot mechanism10.As shown in these figures,scooter100includes afirst frame member102and asecond frame member104pivotally coupled together viapivot mechanism10. Thefirst frame member102includes a generallyelongate support106having afirst end108and asecond end110. Thepivot mechanism10may be coupled to thefirst frame member102adjacent thefirst end108. Thesecond end110includes arear wheel112for supporting thescooter100on a surface. A platform ordeck114may be coupled to support106and configured to support a rider on thescooter100. In some embodiments, abrake mechanism116may also be provided.Thesecond frame member104includes asteering assembly118that allows the user to steer thescooter100, ahead tube120configured to receive thesteering assembly118, and a brace orarm122that couples thehead tube120to thepivot mechanism10. Thesteering assembly118includes ahandlebar stem124having ahandlebar126coupled to one end thereof to provide a grasping point for the user to turn or otherwise manipulate thesteering assembly118. Thesteering assembly118also includes afork128having afront wheel130rotatably mounted thereto, and afork stem132that extends throughhead tube120and is configured to couple tohandlebar stem124. Acover134may be provided at the location where thefork stem132and handlebar stem124are coupled. Thehead tube120is tubular and receives thesteering assembly118therethrough. Thesteering assembly118is secured to thehead tube120via upper andlower bearings136,138, respectively. Such a configuration allows thehandlebar126to be turned in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to turn thefront wheel130and thereby control the direction of thescooter100.In this embodiment, thebase member16ofpivot mechanism10may be coupled to thefirst frame member102while the rotatingmember18may be coupled to thesecond frame member104. In operation, when thepush pin46is in one of its secured positions such that thekeys74engage thekeyways76a, thesecond frame member104may be in a first position relative to thefirst frame member102, wherein thesteering assembly118is in an upright, ready-to-use position (FIG. 3). To fold thescooter100, thepush button56on thepush pin46may be pressed by a user so as to move thepush pin46to a release position. When in the release position, thesecond frame member104may be rotated relative to thefirst frame member102toward a second position, wherein thesteering assembly118is in a folded position (FIG. 4).In one embodiment, when in the folded position, thepush pin46may remain in the release position such that there is no positive lock when in this position. In an alternative embodiment, however, when in the folded position, thekeys74may engage thekeyways76asuch that thesteering assembly118is locked in the folded position. To move thesteering assembly118back to its ready-to-use position, thepush button56may be pressed again and thesecond frame member104rotated relative to thefirst frame member102. When thesteering assembly118reaches its ready-to-use position, thekeys74will again engage thekeyways76ato lock thesteering assembly118in place.Thepivot mechanism10may be beneficially used on a wide range of scooter designs. For example, U.S. application Ser. No. 29/333,279, filed Mar. 5, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses a scooter design having a unique wide deck configuration. That scooter does not include a pivot mechanism that allows the scooter to fold. However, as shown inFIGS. 5 and 6of the present application, ascooter150having a design similar to that disclosed in the '279 application may incorporatepivot mechanism10to allow a folding feature. Although having a different design, the nomenclature used to describeFIGS. 3 and 4may also be used to describeFIGS. 5 and 6. Accordingly, like reference numerals are used to refer to like features in these figures. Moreover, as those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand the structure and operation ofscooter150based on the description above directed toscooter100, for sake of brevity, a detailed description will be omitted herefrom.Thepivot mechanism10may also be incorporated into various tricycle designs. By way of example, U.S. Application Ser. No. 61/184,951, filed Jun. 8, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses a tricycle having a pivot mechanism. Thepivot mechanism10as disclosed in the present application may be used in a similar manner as that disclosed in the '951 application.In this regard,FIG. 7illustrates atricycle210havingpivot mechanism10incorporated therein. Thetricycle210includes afront frame212, amiddle frame214, and arear frame216. Thefront frame212includes afront fork218operatively coupled to ahandlebar220. Thefront fork218includes afork stem222and a pair of spaced apart forks orlegs224extending therefrom in a generally parallel fashion. Afront wheel226, which defines afront axle228, is positioned between thelegs224and rotatably coupled thereto so as to allow rotation of thefront wheel226relative to thefront frame212. A pair ofpedals230are positioned outboard of thelegs224offront fork218and are operatively coupled to the front wheel226(e.g., such as by being coupled to the front axle228) for allowing the rider to rotate thefront wheel226, and consequently, propel thetricycle210in a certain direction dictated byhandlebar220. Thehandlebar220includes ahandlebar stem232configured to be coupled to thefork stem222and a pair ofhandles234configured to be grasped by the rider for turning thetricycle210in a desired direction. Thehandles234may include grips or other features that facilitate gripping by the user. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that thehandlebar220may have a wide variety of shapes and designs and the invention is not limited to the particular embodiment shown herein.Themiddle frame214includes ahead tube236configured to be coupled to thefront frame212, one or more frame support elements238(one shown in illustrated embodiment), and aknuckle240configured to be coupled torear frame216. As discussed in more detail below, thefront frame212, and more particularly, at least one of thefork stem222and handlebar stem232is configured to be inserted through thehead tube236and rotatably mounted thereto so as to allow thefront frame212to rotate relative to themiddle frame214, and thereby change the direction of thetricycle210through the rotation ofhandlebar220. As illustrated inFIG. 7, theframe support element238includes asaddle244on which the rider of thetricycle210sits.In the exemplary embodiment shown inFIG. 7, therear frame216includes a generally U-shaped member having amiddle portion246and endportions248, on either side thereof. Themiddle portion246is configured to be coupled to themiddle frame214atknuckle240. Moreover, eachend portion248includes arear wheel252rotatably coupled adjacent an end thereof so as to allow rotation of therear wheels252relative to therear frame216.Thetricycle210may include apivot mechanism10that defines afirst frame portion270and asecond frame portion272pivotally coupled together viapivot mechanism10. The position ofpivot mechanism10within thetricycle210may be selected to provide several desirable configurations fortricycle210. For example, as more fully disclosed in the '951 application, it may be desirable fortricycle210to have a high rider configuration, a low rider configuration, and a storage configuration.Pivot mechanism10may provide each of these configurations fortricycle210. Similar to that disclosed in the '951 publication, such configurations may be achieved withpivot mechanism10whenpivot mechanism10is positionedadjacent knuckle240. More particularly, in one embodiment, thepivot mechanism10may be disposed inmiddle frame214adjacent knuckle240.In operation, when thepush pin46is in a first secured position, such that thekeys74engage thekeyways76ainbase member16, thetricycle210may have a high rider configuration, as shown inFIG. 7. Moreover, when thepush pin46is in a second secured position, thetricycle210may have a low rider configuration, as shown inFIG. 8. Furthermore, when thepush pin46is in a third secured position, thetricycle210may have a storage configuration, wherein therear wheels252are essentially tucked underneath themiddle frame214to maketricycle210more compact for storage, as shown inFIG. 9.To move between the various configurations, a user pushes thepush pin46inward and toward the release position. At this point, thefirst frame portion270and asecond frame portion272may be rotated relative to each other. As explained above, when thenext keyway76ainend wall26is encountered, thepush pin46essentially snaps outwardly due to the spring biasing so thatkeys74engagekeyways76ato define a secured position. Such apivot mechanism10allows thetricycle210to be converted between various desired positions in a quick, reliable, and easy manner. Moreover, thepivot mechanism10discussed above is believed to overcome many of the shortcomings of pivot mechanisms used in existing convertible tricycles. By way of example, the design is relatively low cost, relatively simple and minimizes or eliminates sharp edges and potential pinch points.While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in some detail, it is not the intention of the inventor to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. For example, while the improved features disclosed herein have been described in the context of scooters and tricycles, it should be recognized that many of these features may be beneficial to bicycles and possibly other vehicles, or other components associated with these vehicles and therefore, aspects of the invention should not be limited to being applicable to only scooters and tricycles. Thus, the various features of the invention may be used alone or in any combination depending on the needs and preferences of the user.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/227,402, filed Jul. 21, 2009, the specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.TECHNICAL FIELDThe invention relates generally to scooters, tricycles and the like and, more particularly, to an improved pivot mechanism for scooters, tricycles and the like configured to improved their use and functionality.BACKGROUNDScooters and tricycles are among the most popular items for children. Although many developments have improved the original design of these items, conventional designs continue to have shortcomings that manufacturers strive to improve upon. In regard to scooters, many conventional scooter designs allow the scooter to fold so as to facilitate storage, packaging, etc. To this end, many designs call for a fold mechanism that allows the steering assembly to fold over the deck of the scooter. These designs may further include various lock mechanisms that lock the steering assembly in a ready-to-use position and in a storage position.Conventional fold mechanism designs, however, have some drawbacks. By way of example, the fold mechanisms are generally complex in their design and as a result, may be expensive and difficult to manufacture. Additionally, some fold mechanism designs are generally open so as to expose sharp edges and/or moving parts to the user. Such designs are generally undesirable and may present some safety concerns, such as, for example, providing a potential pinch point for the user.In regard to tricycles, there are several versions or types of tricycles that are offered to today's consumers. For example, one type of tricycle is a conventional tricycle design wherein the front wheel is positioned substantially underneath the handlebar and the saddle is located relatively high on the frame. Such a conventional tricycle design is referred to herein as a high rider. Another type of tricycle, however, has a chopper design wherein the front wheel is located forward of the handlebar and the saddle is positioned relatively low on the frame. Such a modified tricycle is referred to herein as a low rider.Conventionally, if a child desired both types of tricycle, his or her parents had to purchase two separate tricycles, each having the desired configuration. However, in some instances, convertible tricycles have been made available capable of converting between the conventional high rider configuration and a low rider configuration. In this regard, these convertible devices typically include costly, relatively complex mechanisms for converting between the two configurations. Additionally, these mechanisms may include exposed parts or surfaces that present relatively sharp edges, provide potential pinch points, and/or pose other safety concerns to the user of the convertible tricycle.Thus, while conventional scooters and tricycles are generally successful for their intended purpose, there remains a need for improved designs that address these and other shortcomings in conventional construction.SUMMARYA pivot mechanism includes a base member configured to be coupled to a first element and a generally cylindrical rotating member configured to be coupled to a second element. The base member includes a bottom wall, a pair of opposed side walls, and a pair of opposed end walls that collectively define a cavity. At least one of the end walls has a first aperture therethrough. The rotating member includes a side wall and a pair of opposed end walls and is at least partially positioned within the cavity of the base member. At least one of the end walls has a second aperture therethrough. An elongate pin extends through the first and second apertures in the base member and rotating member and defines a pivot axis. The rotating member is capable of rotating relative to the base member about the pivot axis to provide relative movement between the first and second elements. The elongate pin is movable in a direction generally parallel to the pivot axis between a secured position and a release position. In the secured position, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member. In the release position, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member.A locking mechanism prevents rotation of the rotating member relative to the base member when the pin is in the secured position. In one embodiment, the locking mechanism includes at least one key on the pin and at least one keyway on the base member. When the key engages the keyway, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member and when the key disengages the keyway, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member. The pin may be biased, such as by a spring, toward the secured position.The pivot mechanism may be incorporated in a wide range of child vehicles. In one embodiment, for example, the pivot mechanism may be incorporated in a scooter. The scooter includes a first frame portion having a deck and a rear wheel and a second frame portion having a steering assembly with a front wheel and a handlebar. The pivot mechanism couples the first and second frame portions to provide pivotal movement therebetween. In this regard, the pivot mechanism defines a ready-to-use position of the scooter and a folded position of the scooter. In another embodiment, the pivot mechanism may be incorporated into a tricycle. The tricycle includes a first frame portion having a steering assembly with a front wheel and a handlebar and a second frame portion having a pair or rear wheels. The pivot mechanism couples the first and second frame portions to provide pivotal movement therebetween. For example, the pivot mechanism defines a high rider configuration and a low rider configuration of the tricycle. The pivot mechanism may also define a storage configuration of the tricycle.A method of pivoting a first frame portion relative to a second frame portion includes moving a push pin in a first direction generally parallel to the pin to disengage a key from a keyway; rotating a rotating member relative to the base member when they key and keyway are disengaged; and moving the push pin in a second direction generally parallel to the pin to engage the key with the keyway and lock the relative positions of the first and second frame portions.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with a general description of the invention given above, and the detailed description given below, serve to explain the invention.FIG. 1is a perspective view of a pivot mechanism in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention;FIG. 2is a perspective exploded view of the pivot mechanism illustrated inFIG. 1;FIG. 3is a side elevation view of a scooter having a pivot mechanism in accordance with one embodiment of the invention and with the steering assembly in an upright, ready-to-use position;FIG. 4is a side elevation view of the scooter shown inFIG. 3, but with the steering assembly in a folded position;FIG. 5is a side elevation view of a scooter having a pivot mechanism in accordance with another embodiment of the invention and with the steering assembly in an upright, ready-to-use position;FIG. 6is a side elevation view of the scooter shown inFIG. 5, but with the steering assembly in a folded position;FIG. 7is a side elevation view of a tricycle having a pivot mechanism in accordance with one embodiment of the invention and with the tricycle in a high-rider configuration;FIG. 8is a side elevation view of the tricycle shown inFIG. 7, but in a low rider configuration; andFIG. 9is a side elevation view of the tricycle shown inFIG. 7, but in a storage configuration.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONReferring now to the drawings and toFIGS. 1 and 2in particular, apivot mechanism10in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown. Thepivot mechanism10is configured to allow afirst element12to rotate relative to asecond element14. Thepivot mechanism10includes abase member16configured to be secured to one of the first orsecond element12,14, and a rotatingmember18rotatably mounted tobase member16and secured to the other of the first orsecond element12,14. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, thepivot mechanism10has a generally closed configuration to reduce or eliminate sharp edges and exposed parts.In one embodiment, thebase member16includes a generally planarbottom wall20, a pair ofopposed side walls22,24, and a pair ofopposed end walls26,28. Thebottom wall20may be configured to be secured to thefirst element12, such as through welding, adhesives, fasteners, or other suitable means. In one embodiment, theside walls22,24do not extend for a full height of thepivot mechanism10, but extend for only a portion of the height. The height of theside walls22,24may vary depending on the particular application. For example, the height of theside walls22,24may be determined by the desired angle through which thesecond element14is configured to move during the pivoting motion. Each of theend walls26,28includes alower portion30and anupper portion32. Thelower portion30is configured to meet theside walls22,24at edges thereof. Theupper portion32, however, is configured to extend above theside walls22,24. In one exemplary embodiment, theupper portion32ofend walls26,28may define a generallyarcuate surface34. For example, in one embodiment thearcuate surface34may be a circular arc. Other arcuate shapes, however, may also be possible. As shown inFIG. 2, thebase member16, and more particularly the walls thereof, defines a cradle that, in turn, generally defines acavity36configured to receive and support the rotatingmember18therein, as explained in more detail below.The rotatingmember18may be generally positioned within thecavity36defined bybase member16and includes a generally cylindrical configuration, as illustrated inFIG. 2. The rotatingmember18includes aside wall38andopposed end walls40,42. Theside wall38may be configured to be secured to thesecond element14, such as through welding, adhesives, fasteners, or other suitable means. When the rotatingmember18is positioned withincavity36, theend walls40,42may be adjacent theend walls26,28of the base member16(e.g., may abut or be slightly spaced therefrom). Additionally, theouter surface44ofside wall38may be generally flush with thearcuate surface34defined by theend walls26,28. Such a configuration provides a relatively smooth and contoured look to pivotmechanism10.To provide the pivotal relation between the first andsecond elements12,14, the rotatingmember18is pivotally or rotatably mounted relative to thebase member16. In this regard,pivot mechanism10includes a generallyelongate push pin46adapted to rotatably mount the rotatingmember18tobase member16and define apivot axis48about which the rotating member18(and thus the second element14) rotates. For reasons that will become clearer below, thepush pin46has a generally cylindrical configuration and includes aninner body portion50having a first cross dimension (e.g., diameter) and anouter body portion52having a second cross dimension less than the first cross dimension to define ashoulder54therebetween. The outer end ofouter body portion52generally defines apush button56.In one embodiment, thepush pin46may be configured to extend along the centerline of the generally cylindrical rotatingmember18. To this end, at least one ofend walls40,42, and preferably both ofend walls40,42, includes acentral aperture58configured to receivepush pin46. Thecentral aperture58may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46, therein. To secure the rotatingmember18to thebase member16, at least one of theend walls26,28ofbase member16also includes acentral aperture60configured to receivepush pin46. In a similar manner as described above, thecentral aperture60may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and may be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46, therein. When thepush pin46is disposed through thecentral apertures58,60of thebase member16and the rotatingmember18, the only relative motion permitted therebetween is rotation abovepivot axis48.To secure thepush pin46in place within thebase member16and rotatingmember18, thepivot mechanism10may include a pair ofcover plates62,64secured to the outer surface ofend walls26,28, respectively. By way of example, and in one embodiment, thecover plates62,64and endwalls26,28may include threadedbores66configured to receive a threadedfastener68to secure thecover plates62,64thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other suitable fasteners to secure thecover plates62,64to theend walls26,28ofbase member16. In one embodiment, thecover plates62,64may be generally circular in shape. Thus, for example, at least a portion of the outer edge ofcover plates62,64may be generally flush with thearcuate surface34defined by theend walls26,28. Again, such a configuration provides a relatively smooth and contoured look to pivotmechanism10.As shown inFIG. 2,cover plate62includes acentral aperture70adapted to receive thepush pin46. Thecentral aperture70may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theouter body portion52ofpush pin46, therein. Moreover, the size ofcentral aperture70is such that, while capable of receiving theouter body portion52therein,central aperture70is smaller than theinner body portion50ofpush pin46. In this way, theinner body portion50is too large to extend throughcentral aperture70. Accordingly, once thepush pin46is in place and thecover plate62is secured to thebase member16, thepush pin46is not capable of being removed from thecentral apertures58,60ofbase member16and rotatingmember18.In regard to coverplate64, in one embodiment,cover plate64includes ablind bore72, as shown inFIG. 2. The blind bore72may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snuggly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, an end of theouter body portion52. The blind bore72is closed off by a solid wall and thus, thepush pin46will not be able to be removed fromcentral apertures58,60ofbase member16and rotatingmember18by moving thepush pin46alongpivot axis48and towardcover plate64.In one aspect in accordance with the invention, in addition to providing thepivot axis48forpivot mechanism10, thepush pin46also provides at least in part a locking mechanism for securing thesecond element14in at least one, and preferably a plurality of positions, relative to thefirst element12. In this regard, the locking mechanism includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of projections orkeys74onpush pin46that cooperate with at least one, and preferably a plurality of recesses or keyways76formed in thebase member16and rotatingmember18. Whenkeys74engage certain keyways76, rotating member18(and thus second element14) is prevented from rotating relative to base member16(and thus first element12). However, whenkeys74disengage certain keyways76, rotatingmember18may be rotated relative tobase member16.As shown in more detail inFIG. 2,push pin46includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of,keys74projecting radially therefrom. As shown in this figure, thekeys74project from theinner body portion50and extend in a direction generally parallel to thepivot axis48and beginning at theshoulder54. In one embodiment, thekeys74extend for only a portion of the length of theinner body portion50. However, the length is sufficient to permit proper operation of the locking mechanism as explained in more detail below. Thekeys74are configured to cooperate with keyways76formed in thebase member16and rotatingmember18. To this end, and as illustrated inFIG. 2,end wall26ofbase member16includes at least one, and preferably a plurality ofkeyways76aconfigured to engage thekeys74. In one embodiment, thekeyways76amay be configured as recesses or notches that are open tocentral aperture60and extend radially outward therefrom. Similarly,end wall40of rotatingmember18includes at least one, and preferably a plurality ofkeyways76bconfigured to engage thekeys74. In one embodiment, thekeyways76bmay be configured as recesses or notches that are open tocentral aperture58and extend radially outward therefrom.Operation of the locking mechanism will now be described. As an initial matter, it should be realized that thepush pin46is movable in a direction generally parallel to thepivot axis48between a first, secured position, wherein the first andsecond elements12,14are fixed relative to each other (e.g., the rotatingmember18is not permitted to rotate relative to base member16), and a release position, wherein the first andsecond elements12,14are movable relative to each other (e.g., the rotatingmember18is permitted to rotate relative to the base member16). As illustrated inFIG. 2, thepush pin46may be spring biased. More particularly,push pin46may be spring biased in a direction parallel to thepivot axis48and in a direction towardcover plate62. To this end,pivot mechanism10may include aspring78having one end configured to engage thepush pin46, such as adjacent aninner end80thereof, and another end configured to engage thecover plate64. In one embodiment, for example, the other end of thespring78may be configured to engage the solid wall of blind bore72formed incover plate64. As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, other arrangements are also possible to provide a biasing force to pushpin46in a preferred direction. It should be noted that even though thepush pin46is spring biased, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46remains too large to extend into theaperture70ofcover plate62.In an exemplary embodiment, thespring78biases thepush pin46toward the secured position. In the secured position, thekeys74engage thekeyways76ainend wall26ofbase member16and also engage thekeyways76bin theend wall40of rotatingmember18. Because thekeys74engage bothkeyways76a,76b, the rotatingmember18is prevented from rotating relative tobase member16. Moreover, as illustrated inFIG. 1, in the secured position, thepush button56projects throughcentral aperture70incover plate62and slightly beyond anouter surface82thereof. This allows a user to depress thepush button56inwardly and move thepush pin46toward the release position.As thepush pin46is being depressed inwardly against the bias fromspring78, thekeys74move in a direction parallel to thepivot axis48so as to disengage thekeyways76ain theend wall26ofbase member16. In other words, thekeys74are positioned inwardly ofend wall26such that rotation of rotatingmember18is now permitted relative tobase member16. As rotation begins, in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the end surfaces84ofkeys74engage theinner wall surface86ofend wall26. Thus, the user may stop pressingpush button56and thepush pin46will remain in the release position. Thepush pin46remains in the release position as the rotatingmember18is turned until thenext keyway76ain theend wall26is reached. When thenext keyway76ais reached, the bias ofspring78causes thepush pin46to move outwardly toward the secured position so thatkeys74re-engage keyways76ainbase member16to once again prevent the rotation of rotatingmember18relative tobase member16. When thepush pin46is depressed, thekeys74, while configured to disengage thekeyways76a, should not disengage thekeyways76bin theend wall40of rotatingmember18. In this regard, when thepush pin46is fully depressed, the inner end ofpush pin46may contact the bottom solid wall of blind bore72to prevent thekeys74from disengagingkeyways76b.The number ofkeys74and keyways76may vary depending on the application and the number of positions in which it is desired to fix the relative positions of the first andsecond elements12,14. For example, it is contemplated that in most applications, thepush pin46may include only one or twokeys74. Of course,more keys74are possible should it be necessary to meet the needs or desires of a particular application. The number ofkeyways76ainend wall26ofbase member16generally corresponds to the number of desired fixed positions between the first andsecond elements12,14. For example, it is contemplated that in most applications, theend wall26may be configured to secure one, two or three different relative positions of first andsecond elements12,14. Of course, more keyways and fixed positions are possible should it be necessary to meet the needs or desires of a particular application.Thepivot mechanism10as described above may be incorporated into a wide range of items including without limitation, scooters, tricycles, bicycles, and other pedaled or non-pedaled vehicles. For example, as shown inFIGS. 3 and 4,pivot mechanism10may be incorporated into ascooter100to allow a first portion of thescooter100to fold relative to a second portion of thescooter100. As previously discussed, while folding scooters are generally known in the art, the various mechanisms that permit the folding have drawbacks addressed bypivot mechanism10.As shown in these figures,scooter100includes afirst frame member102and asecond frame member104pivotally coupled together viapivot mechanism10. Thefirst frame member102includes a generallyelongate support106having afirst end108and asecond end110. Thepivot mechanism10may be coupled to thefirst frame member102adjacent thefirst end108. Thesecond end110includes arear wheel112for supporting thescooter100on a surface. A platform ordeck114may be coupled to support106and configured to support a rider on thescooter100. In some embodiments, abrake mechanism116may also be provided.Thesecond frame member104includes asteering assembly118that allows the user to steer thescooter100, ahead tube120configured to receive thesteering assembly118, and a brace orarm122that couples thehead tube120to thepivot mechanism10. Thesteering assembly118includes ahandlebar stem124having ahandlebar126coupled to one end thereof to provide a grasping point for the user to turn or otherwise manipulate thesteering assembly118. Thesteering assembly118also includes afork128having afront wheel130rotatably mounted thereto, and afork stem132that extends throughhead tube120and is configured to couple tohandlebar stem124. Acover134may be provided at the location where thefork stem132and handlebar stem124are coupled. Thehead tube120is tubular and receives thesteering assembly118therethrough. Thesteering assembly118is secured to thehead tube120via upper andlower bearings136,138, respectively. Such a configuration allows thehandlebar126to be turned in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to turn thefront wheel130and thereby control the direction of thescooter100.In this embodiment, thebase member16ofpivot mechanism10may be coupled to thefirst frame member102while the rotatingmember18may be coupled to thesecond frame member104. In operation, when thepush pin46is in one of its secured positions such that thekeys74engage thekeyways76a, thesecond frame member104may be in a first position relative to thefirst frame member102, wherein thesteering assembly118is in an upright, ready-to-use position (FIG. 3). To fold thescooter100, thepush button56on thepush pin46may be pressed by a user so as to move thepush pin46to a release position. When in the release position, thesecond frame member104may be rotated relative to thefirst frame member102toward a second position, wherein thesteering assembly118is in a folded position (FIG. 4).In one embodiment, when in the folded position, thepush pin46may remain in the release position such that there is no positive lock when in this position. In an alternative embodiment, however, when in the folded position, thekeys74may engage thekeyways76asuch that thesteering assembly118is locked in the folded position. To move thesteering assembly118back to its ready-to-use position, thepush button56may be pressed again and thesecond frame member104rotated relative to thefirst frame member102. When thesteering assembly118reaches its ready-to-use position, thekeys74will again engage thekeyways76ato lock thesteering assembly118in place.Thepivot mechanism10may be beneficially used on a wide range of scooter designs. For example, U.S. application Ser. No. 29/333,279, filed Mar. 5, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses a scooter design having a unique wide deck configuration. That scooter does not include a pivot mechanism that allows the scooter to fold. However, as shown inFIGS. 5 and 6of the present application, ascooter150having a design similar to that disclosed in the '279 application may incorporatepivot mechanism10to allow a folding feature. Although having a different design, the nomenclature used to describeFIGS. 3 and 4may also be used to describeFIGS. 5 and 6. Accordingly, like reference numerals are used to refer to like features in these figures. Moreover, as those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand the structure and operation ofscooter150based on the description above directed toscooter100, for sake of brevity, a detailed description will be omitted herefrom.Thepivot mechanism10may also be incorporated into various tricycle designs. By way of example, U.S. Application Ser. No. 61/184,951, filed Jun. 8, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses a tricycle having a pivot mechanism. Thepivot mechanism10as disclosed in the present application may be used in a similar manner as that disclosed in the '951 application.In this regard,FIG. 7illustrates atricycle210havingpivot mechanism10incorporated therein. Thetricycle210includes afront frame212, amiddle frame214, and arear frame216. Thefront frame212includes afront fork218operatively coupled to ahandlebar220. Thefront fork218includes afork stem222and a pair of spaced apart forks orlegs224extending therefrom in a generally parallel fashion. Afront wheel226, which defines afront axle228, is positioned between thelegs224and rotatably coupled thereto so as to allow rotation of thefront wheel226relative to thefront frame212. A pair ofpedals230are positioned outboard of thelegs224offront fork218and are operatively coupled to the front wheel226(e.g., such as by being coupled to the front axle228) for allowing the rider to rotate thefront wheel226, and consequently, propel thetricycle210in a certain direction dictated byhandlebar220. Thehandlebar220includes ahandlebar stem232configured to be coupled to thefork stem222and a pair ofhandles234configured to be grasped by the rider for turning thetricycle210in a desired direction. Thehandles234may include grips or other features that facilitate gripping by the user. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that thehandlebar220may have a wide variety of shapes and designs and the invention is not limited to the particular embodiment shown herein.Themiddle frame214includes ahead tube236configured to be coupled to thefront frame212, one or more frame support elements238(one shown in illustrated embodiment), and aknuckle240configured to be coupled torear frame216. As discussed in more detail below, thefront frame212, and more particularly, at least one of thefork stem222and handlebar stem232is configured to be inserted through thehead tube236and rotatably mounted thereto so as to allow thefront frame212to rotate relative to themiddle frame214, and thereby change the direction of thetricycle210through the rotation ofhandlebar220. As illustrated inFIG. 7, theframe support element238includes asaddle244on which the rider of thetricycle210sits.In the exemplary embodiment shown inFIG. 7, therear frame216includes a generally U-shaped member having amiddle portion246and endportions248, on either side thereof. Themiddle portion246is configured to be coupled to themiddle frame214atknuckle240. Moreover, eachend portion248includes arear wheel252rotatably coupled adjacent an end thereof so as to allow rotation of therear wheels252relative to therear frame216.Thetricycle210may include apivot mechanism10that defines afirst frame portion270and asecond frame portion272pivotally coupled together viapivot mechanism10. The position ofpivot mechanism10within thetricycle210may be selected to provide several desirable configurations fortricycle210. For example, as more fully disclosed in the '951 application, it may be desirable fortricycle210to have a high rider configuration, a low rider configuration, and a storage configuration.Pivot mechanism10may provide each of these configurations fortricycle210. Similar to that disclosed in the '951 publication, such configurations may be achieved withpivot mechanism10whenpivot mechanism10is positionedadjacent knuckle240. More particularly, in one embodiment, thepivot mechanism10may be disposed inmiddle frame214adjacent knuckle240.In operation, when thepush pin46is in a first secured position, such that thekeys74engage thekeyways76ainbase member16, thetricycle210may have a high rider configuration, as shown inFIG. 7. Moreover, when thepush pin46is in a second secured position, thetricycle210may have a low rider configuration, as shown inFIG. 8. Furthermore, when thepush pin46is in a third secured position, thetricycle210may have a storage configuration, wherein therear wheels252are essentially tucked underneath themiddle frame214to maketricycle210more compact for storage, as shown inFIG. 9.To move between the various configurations, a user pushes thepush pin46inward and toward the release position. At this point, thefirst frame portion270and asecond frame portion272may be rotated relative to each other. As explained above, when thenext keyway76ainend wall26is encountered, thepush pin46essentially snaps outwardly due to the spring biasing so thatkeys74engagekeyways76ato define a secured position. Such apivot mechanism10allows thetricycle210to be converted between various desired positions in a quick, reliable, and easy manner. Moreover, thepivot mechanism10discussed above is believed to overcome many of the shortcomings of pivot mechanisms used in existing convertible tricycles. By way of example, the design is relatively low cost, relatively simple and minimizes or eliminates sharp edges and potential pinch points.While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in some detail, it is not the intention of the inventor to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. For example, while the improved features disclosed herein have been described in the context of scooters and tricycles, it should be recognized that many of these features may be beneficial to bicycles and possibly other vehicles, or other components associated with these vehicles and therefore, aspects of the invention should not be limited to being applicable to only scooters and tricycles. Thus, the various features of the invention may be used alone or in any combination depending on the needs and preferences of the user.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/227,402, filed Jul. 21, 2009, the specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention relates generally to scooters, tricycles and the like and, more particularly, to an improved pivot mechanism for scooters, tricycles and the like configured to improved their use and functionality.

Scooters and tricycles are among the most popular items for children. Although many developments have improved the original design of these items, conventional designs continue to have shortcomings that manufacturers strive to improve upon. In regard to scooters, many conventional scooter designs allow the scooter to fold so as to facilitate storage, packaging, etc. To this end, many designs call for a fold mechanism that allows the steering assembly to fold over the deck of the scooter. These designs may further include various lock mechanisms that lock the steering assembly in a ready-to-use position and in a storage position.

Conventional fold mechanism designs, however, have some drawbacks. By way of example, the fold mechanisms are generally complex in their design and as a result, may be expensive and difficult to manufacture. Additionally, some fold mechanism designs are generally open so as to expose sharp edges and/or moving parts to the user. Such designs are generally undesirable and may present some safety concerns, such as, for example, providing a potential pinch point for the user.

In regard to tricycles, there are several versions or types of tricycles that are offered to today's consumers. For example, one type of tricycle is a conventional tricycle design wherein the front wheel is positioned substantially underneath the handlebar and the saddle is located relatively high on the frame. Such a conventional tricycle design is referred to herein as a high rider. Another type of tricycle, however, has a chopper design wherein the front wheel is located forward of the handlebar and the saddle is positioned relatively low on the frame. Such a modified tricycle is referred to herein as a low rider.

Conventionally, if a child desired both types of tricycle, his or her parents had to purchase two separate tricycles, each having the desired configuration. However, in some instances, convertible tricycles have been made available capable of converting between the conventional high rider configuration and a low rider configuration. In this regard, these convertible devices typically include costly, relatively complex mechanisms for converting between the two configurations. Additionally, these mechanisms may include exposed parts or surfaces that present relatively sharp edges, provide potential pinch points, and/or pose other safety concerns to the user of the convertible tricycle.

Thus, while conventional scooters and tricycles are generally successful for their intended purpose, there remains a need for improved designs that address these and other shortcomings in conventional construction.

A pivot mechanism includes a base member configured to be coupled to a first element and a generally cylindrical rotating member configured to be coupled to a second element. The base member includes a bottom wall, a pair of opposed side walls, and a pair of opposed end walls that collectively define a cavity. At least one of the end walls has a first aperture therethrough. The rotating member includes a side wall and a pair of opposed end walls and is at least partially positioned within the cavity of the base member. At least one of the end walls has a second aperture therethrough. An elongate pin extends through the first and second apertures in the base member and rotating member and defines a pivot axis. The rotating member is capable of rotating relative to the base member about the pivot axis to provide relative movement between the first and second elements. The elongate pin is movable in a direction generally parallel to the pivot axis between a secured position and a release position. In the secured position, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member. In the release position, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member.

A locking mechanism prevents rotation of the rotating member relative to the base member when the pin is in the secured position. In one embodiment, the locking mechanism includes at least one key on the pin and at least one keyway on the base member. When the key engages the keyway, the rotating member is prevented from rotating relative to the base member and when the key disengages the keyway, the rotating member is permitted to rotate relative to the base member. The pin may be biased, such as by a spring, toward the secured position.

The pivot mechanism may be incorporated in a wide range of child vehicles. In one embodiment, for example, the pivot mechanism may be incorporated in a scooter. The scooter includes a first frame portion having a deck and a rear wheel and a second frame portion having a steering assembly with a front wheel and a handlebar. The pivot mechanism couples the first and second frame portions to provide pivotal movement therebetween. In this regard, the pivot mechanism defines a ready-to-use position of the scooter and a folded position of the scooter. In another embodiment, the pivot mechanism may be incorporated into a tricycle. The tricycle includes a first frame portion having a steering assembly with a front wheel and a handlebar and a second frame portion having a pair or rear wheels. The pivot mechanism couples the first and second frame portions to provide pivotal movement therebetween. For example, the pivot mechanism defines a high rider configuration and a low rider configuration of the tricycle. The pivot mechanism may also define a storage configuration of the tricycle.

A method of pivoting a first frame portion relative to a second frame portion includes moving a push pin in a first direction generally parallel to the pin to disengage a key from a keyway; rotating a rotating member relative to the base member when they key and keyway are disengaged; and moving the push pin in a second direction generally parallel to the pin to engage the key with the keyway and lock the relative positions of the first and second frame portions.

Referring now to the drawings and toFIGS. 1 and 2in particular, apivot mechanism10in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown. Thepivot mechanism10is configured to allow afirst element12to rotate relative to asecond element14. Thepivot mechanism10includes abase member16configured to be secured to one of the first orsecond element12,14, and a rotatingmember18rotatably mounted tobase member16and secured to the other of the first orsecond element12,14. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, thepivot mechanism10has a generally closed configuration to reduce or eliminate sharp edges and exposed parts.

In one embodiment, thebase member16includes a generally planarbottom wall20, a pair ofopposed side walls22,24, and a pair ofopposed end walls26,28. Thebottom wall20may be configured to be secured to thefirst element12, such as through welding, adhesives, fasteners, or other suitable means. In one embodiment, theside walls22,24do not extend for a full height of thepivot mechanism10, but extend for only a portion of the height. The height of theside walls22,24may vary depending on the particular application. For example, the height of theside walls22,24may be determined by the desired angle through which thesecond element14is configured to move during the pivoting motion. Each of theend walls26,28includes alower portion30and anupper portion32. Thelower portion30is configured to meet theside walls22,24at edges thereof. Theupper portion32, however, is configured to extend above theside walls22,24. In one exemplary embodiment, theupper portion32ofend walls26,28may define a generallyarcuate surface34. For example, in one embodiment thearcuate surface34may be a circular arc. Other arcuate shapes, however, may also be possible. As shown inFIG. 2, thebase member16, and more particularly the walls thereof, defines a cradle that, in turn, generally defines acavity36configured to receive and support the rotatingmember18therein, as explained in more detail below.

The rotatingmember18may be generally positioned within thecavity36defined bybase member16and includes a generally cylindrical configuration, as illustrated inFIG. 2. The rotatingmember18includes aside wall38andopposed end walls40,42. Theside wall38may be configured to be secured to thesecond element14, such as through welding, adhesives, fasteners, or other suitable means. When the rotatingmember18is positioned withincavity36, theend walls40,42may be adjacent theend walls26,28of the base member16(e.g., may abut or be slightly spaced therefrom). Additionally, theouter surface44ofside wall38may be generally flush with thearcuate surface34defined by theend walls26,28. Such a configuration provides a relatively smooth and contoured look to pivotmechanism10.

To provide the pivotal relation between the first andsecond elements12,14, the rotatingmember18is pivotally or rotatably mounted relative to thebase member16. In this regard,pivot mechanism10includes a generallyelongate push pin46adapted to rotatably mount the rotatingmember18tobase member16and define apivot axis48about which the rotating member18(and thus the second element14) rotates. For reasons that will become clearer below, thepush pin46has a generally cylindrical configuration and includes aninner body portion50having a first cross dimension (e.g., diameter) and anouter body portion52having a second cross dimension less than the first cross dimension to define ashoulder54therebetween. The outer end ofouter body portion52generally defines apush button56.

In one embodiment, thepush pin46may be configured to extend along the centerline of the generally cylindrical rotatingmember18. To this end, at least one ofend walls40,42, and preferably both ofend walls40,42, includes acentral aperture58configured to receivepush pin46. Thecentral aperture58may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46, therein. To secure the rotatingmember18to thebase member16, at least one of theend walls26,28ofbase member16also includes acentral aperture60configured to receivepush pin46. In a similar manner as described above, thecentral aperture60may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and may be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46, therein. When thepush pin46is disposed through thecentral apertures58,60of thebase member16and the rotatingmember18, the only relative motion permitted therebetween is rotation abovepivot axis48.

To secure thepush pin46in place within thebase member16and rotatingmember18, thepivot mechanism10may include a pair ofcover plates62,64secured to the outer surface ofend walls26,28, respectively. By way of example, and in one embodiment, thecover plates62,64and endwalls26,28may include threadedbores66configured to receive a threadedfastener68to secure thecover plates62,64thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other suitable fasteners to secure thecover plates62,64to theend walls26,28ofbase member16. In one embodiment, thecover plates62,64may be generally circular in shape. Thus, for example, at least a portion of the outer edge ofcover plates62,64may be generally flush with thearcuate surface34defined by theend walls26,28. Again, such a configuration provides a relatively smooth and contoured look to pivotmechanism10.

As shown inFIG. 2,cover plate62includes acentral aperture70adapted to receive thepush pin46. Thecentral aperture70may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snugly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, theouter body portion52ofpush pin46, therein. Moreover, the size ofcentral aperture70is such that, while capable of receiving theouter body portion52therein,central aperture70is smaller than theinner body portion50ofpush pin46. In this way, theinner body portion50is too large to extend throughcentral aperture70. Accordingly, once thepush pin46is in place and thecover plate62is secured to thebase member16, thepush pin46is not capable of being removed from thecentral apertures58,60ofbase member16and rotatingmember18.

In regard to coverplate64, in one embodiment,cover plate64includes ablind bore72, as shown inFIG. 2. The blind bore72may have the same cross-sectional shape as push pin46(e.g., circular) and be sized to snuggly receive thepush pin46, and more particularly, an end of theouter body portion52. The blind bore72is closed off by a solid wall and thus, thepush pin46will not be able to be removed fromcentral apertures58,60ofbase member16and rotatingmember18by moving thepush pin46alongpivot axis48and towardcover plate64.

In one aspect in accordance with the invention, in addition to providing thepivot axis48forpivot mechanism10, thepush pin46also provides at least in part a locking mechanism for securing thesecond element14in at least one, and preferably a plurality of positions, relative to thefirst element12. In this regard, the locking mechanism includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of projections orkeys74onpush pin46that cooperate with at least one, and preferably a plurality of recesses or keyways76formed in thebase member16and rotatingmember18. Whenkeys74engage certain keyways76, rotating member18(and thus second element14) is prevented from rotating relative to base member16(and thus first element12). However, whenkeys74disengage certain keyways76, rotatingmember18may be rotated relative tobase member16.

As shown in more detail inFIG. 2,push pin46includes at least one, and preferably a plurality of,keys74projecting radially therefrom. As shown in this figure, thekeys74project from theinner body portion50and extend in a direction generally parallel to thepivot axis48and beginning at theshoulder54. In one embodiment, thekeys74extend for only a portion of the length of theinner body portion50. However, the length is sufficient to permit proper operation of the locking mechanism as explained in more detail below. Thekeys74are configured to cooperate with keyways76formed in thebase member16and rotatingmember18. To this end, and as illustrated inFIG. 2,end wall26ofbase member16includes at least one, and preferably a plurality ofkeyways76aconfigured to engage thekeys74. In one embodiment, thekeyways76amay be configured as recesses or notches that are open tocentral aperture60and extend radially outward therefrom. Similarly,end wall40of rotatingmember18includes at least one, and preferably a plurality ofkeyways76bconfigured to engage thekeys74. In one embodiment, thekeyways76bmay be configured as recesses or notches that are open tocentral aperture58and extend radially outward therefrom.

Operation of the locking mechanism will now be described. As an initial matter, it should be realized that thepush pin46is movable in a direction generally parallel to thepivot axis48between a first, secured position, wherein the first andsecond elements12,14are fixed relative to each other (e.g., the rotatingmember18is not permitted to rotate relative to base member16), and a release position, wherein the first andsecond elements12,14are movable relative to each other (e.g., the rotatingmember18is permitted to rotate relative to the base member16). As illustrated inFIG. 2, thepush pin46may be spring biased. More particularly,push pin46may be spring biased in a direction parallel to thepivot axis48and in a direction towardcover plate62. To this end,pivot mechanism10may include aspring78having one end configured to engage thepush pin46, such as adjacent aninner end80thereof, and another end configured to engage thecover plate64. In one embodiment, for example, the other end of thespring78may be configured to engage the solid wall of blind bore72formed incover plate64. As recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, other arrangements are also possible to provide a biasing force to pushpin46in a preferred direction. It should be noted that even though thepush pin46is spring biased, theinner body portion50ofpush pin46remains too large to extend into theaperture70ofcover plate62.

In an exemplary embodiment, thespring78biases thepush pin46toward the secured position. In the secured position, thekeys74engage thekeyways76ainend wall26ofbase member16and also engage thekeyways76bin theend wall40of rotatingmember18. Because thekeys74engage bothkeyways76a,76b, the rotatingmember18is prevented from rotating relative tobase member16. Moreover, as illustrated inFIG. 1, in the secured position, thepush button56projects throughcentral aperture70incover plate62and slightly beyond anouter surface82thereof. This allows a user to depress thepush button56inwardly and move thepush pin46toward the release position.

As thepush pin46is being depressed inwardly against the bias fromspring78, thekeys74move in a direction parallel to thepivot axis48so as to disengage thekeyways76ain theend wall26ofbase member16. In other words, thekeys74are positioned inwardly ofend wall26such that rotation of rotatingmember18is now permitted relative tobase member16. As rotation begins, in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the end surfaces84ofkeys74engage theinner wall surface86ofend wall26. Thus, the user may stop pressingpush button56and thepush pin46will remain in the release position. Thepush pin46remains in the release position as the rotatingmember18is turned until thenext keyway76ain theend wall26is reached. When thenext keyway76ais reached, the bias ofspring78causes thepush pin46to move outwardly toward the secured position so thatkeys74re-engage keyways76ainbase member16to once again prevent the rotation of rotatingmember18relative tobase member16. When thepush pin46is depressed, thekeys74, while configured to disengage thekeyways76a, should not disengage thekeyways76bin theend wall40of rotatingmember18. In this regard, when thepush pin46is fully depressed, the inner end ofpush pin46may contact the bottom solid wall of blind bore72to prevent thekeys74from disengagingkeyways76b.

The number ofkeys74and keyways76may vary depending on the application and the number of positions in which it is desired to fix the relative positions of the first andsecond elements12,14. For example, it is contemplated that in most applications, thepush pin46may include only one or twokeys74. Of course,more keys74are possible should it be necessary to meet the needs or desires of a particular application. The number ofkeyways76ainend wall26ofbase member16generally corresponds to the number of desired fixed positions between the first andsecond elements12,14. For example, it is contemplated that in most applications, theend wall26may be configured to secure one, two or three different relative positions of first andsecond elements12,14. Of course, more keyways and fixed positions are possible should it be necessary to meet the needs or desires of a particular application.

Thepivot mechanism10as described above may be incorporated into a wide range of items including without limitation, scooters, tricycles, bicycles, and other pedaled or non-pedaled vehicles. For example, as shown inFIGS. 3 and 4,pivot mechanism10may be incorporated into ascooter100to allow a first portion of thescooter100to fold relative to a second portion of thescooter100. As previously discussed, while folding scooters are generally known in the art, the various mechanisms that permit the folding have drawbacks addressed bypivot mechanism10.

As shown in these figures,scooter100includes afirst frame member102and asecond frame member104pivotally coupled together viapivot mechanism10. Thefirst frame member102includes a generallyelongate support106having afirst end108and asecond end110. Thepivot mechanism10may be coupled to thefirst frame member102adjacent thefirst end108. Thesecond end110includes arear wheel112for supporting thescooter100on a surface. A platform ordeck114may be coupled to support106and configured to support a rider on thescooter100. In some embodiments, abrake mechanism116may also be provided.

Thesecond frame member104includes asteering assembly118that allows the user to steer thescooter100, ahead tube120configured to receive thesteering assembly118, and a brace orarm122that couples thehead tube120to thepivot mechanism10. Thesteering assembly118includes ahandlebar stem124having ahandlebar126coupled to one end thereof to provide a grasping point for the user to turn or otherwise manipulate thesteering assembly118. Thesteering assembly118also includes afork128having afront wheel130rotatably mounted thereto, and afork stem132that extends throughhead tube120and is configured to couple tohandlebar stem124. Acover134may be provided at the location where thefork stem132and handlebar stem124are coupled. Thehead tube120is tubular and receives thesteering assembly118therethrough. Thesteering assembly118is secured to thehead tube120via upper andlower bearings136,138, respectively. Such a configuration allows thehandlebar126to be turned in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to turn thefront wheel130and thereby control the direction of thescooter100.

In this embodiment, thebase member16ofpivot mechanism10may be coupled to thefirst frame member102while the rotatingmember18may be coupled to thesecond frame member104. In operation, when thepush pin46is in one of its secured positions such that thekeys74engage thekeyways76a, thesecond frame member104may be in a first position relative to thefirst frame member102, wherein thesteering assembly118is in an upright, ready-to-use position (FIG. 3). To fold thescooter100, thepush button56on thepush pin46may be pressed by a user so as to move thepush pin46to a release position. When in the release position, thesecond frame member104may be rotated relative to thefirst frame member102toward a second position, wherein thesteering assembly118is in a folded position (FIG. 4).

In one embodiment, when in the folded position, thepush pin46may remain in the release position such that there is no positive lock when in this position. In an alternative embodiment, however, when in the folded position, thekeys74may engage thekeyways76asuch that thesteering assembly118is locked in the folded position. To move thesteering assembly118back to its ready-to-use position, thepush button56may be pressed again and thesecond frame member104rotated relative to thefirst frame member102. When thesteering assembly118reaches its ready-to-use position, thekeys74will again engage thekeyways76ato lock thesteering assembly118in place.

Thepivot mechanism10may be beneficially used on a wide range of scooter designs. For example, U.S. application Ser. No. 29/333,279, filed Mar. 5, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses a scooter design having a unique wide deck configuration. That scooter does not include a pivot mechanism that allows the scooter to fold. However, as shown inFIGS. 5 and 6of the present application, ascooter150having a design similar to that disclosed in the '279 application may incorporatepivot mechanism10to allow a folding feature. Although having a different design, the nomenclature used to describeFIGS. 3 and 4may also be used to describeFIGS. 5 and 6. Accordingly, like reference numerals are used to refer to like features in these figures. Moreover, as those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand the structure and operation ofscooter150based on the description above directed toscooter100, for sake of brevity, a detailed description will be omitted herefrom.

Thepivot mechanism10may also be incorporated into various tricycle designs. By way of example, U.S. Application Ser. No. 61/184,951, filed Jun. 8, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses a tricycle having a pivot mechanism. Thepivot mechanism10as disclosed in the present application may be used in a similar manner as that disclosed in the '951 application.

In this regard,FIG. 7illustrates atricycle210havingpivot mechanism10incorporated therein. Thetricycle210includes afront frame212, amiddle frame214, and arear frame216. Thefront frame212includes afront fork218operatively coupled to ahandlebar220. Thefront fork218includes afork stem222and a pair of spaced apart forks orlegs224extending therefrom in a generally parallel fashion. Afront wheel226, which defines afront axle228, is positioned between thelegs224and rotatably coupled thereto so as to allow rotation of thefront wheel226relative to thefront frame212. A pair ofpedals230are positioned outboard of thelegs224offront fork218and are operatively coupled to the front wheel226(e.g., such as by being coupled to the front axle228) for allowing the rider to rotate thefront wheel226, and consequently, propel thetricycle210in a certain direction dictated byhandlebar220. Thehandlebar220includes ahandlebar stem232configured to be coupled to thefork stem222and a pair ofhandles234configured to be grasped by the rider for turning thetricycle210in a desired direction. Thehandles234may include grips or other features that facilitate gripping by the user. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that thehandlebar220may have a wide variety of shapes and designs and the invention is not limited to the particular embodiment shown herein.

Themiddle frame214includes ahead tube236configured to be coupled to thefront frame212, one or more frame support elements238(one shown in illustrated embodiment), and aknuckle240configured to be coupled torear frame216. As discussed in more detail below, thefront frame212, and more particularly, at least one of thefork stem222and handlebar stem232is configured to be inserted through thehead tube236and rotatably mounted thereto so as to allow thefront frame212to rotate relative to themiddle frame214, and thereby change the direction of thetricycle210through the rotation ofhandlebar220. As illustrated inFIG. 7, theframe support element238includes asaddle244on which the rider of thetricycle210sits.

In the exemplary embodiment shown inFIG. 7, therear frame216includes a generally U-shaped member having amiddle portion246and endportions248, on either side thereof. Themiddle portion246is configured to be coupled to themiddle frame214atknuckle240. Moreover, eachend portion248includes arear wheel252rotatably coupled adjacent an end thereof so as to allow rotation of therear wheels252relative to therear frame216.

Thetricycle210may include apivot mechanism10that defines afirst frame portion270and asecond frame portion272pivotally coupled together viapivot mechanism10. The position ofpivot mechanism10within thetricycle210may be selected to provide several desirable configurations fortricycle210. For example, as more fully disclosed in the '951 application, it may be desirable fortricycle210to have a high rider configuration, a low rider configuration, and a storage configuration.Pivot mechanism10may provide each of these configurations fortricycle210. Similar to that disclosed in the '951 publication, such configurations may be achieved withpivot mechanism10whenpivot mechanism10is positionedadjacent knuckle240. More particularly, in one embodiment, thepivot mechanism10may be disposed inmiddle frame214adjacent knuckle240.

In operation, when thepush pin46is in a first secured position, such that thekeys74engage thekeyways76ainbase member16, thetricycle210may have a high rider configuration, as shown inFIG. 7. Moreover, when thepush pin46is in a second secured position, thetricycle210may have a low rider configuration, as shown inFIG. 8. Furthermore, when thepush pin46is in a third secured position, thetricycle210may have a storage configuration, wherein therear wheels252are essentially tucked underneath themiddle frame214to maketricycle210more compact for storage, as shown inFIG. 9.

To move between the various configurations, a user pushes thepush pin46inward and toward the release position. At this point, thefirst frame portion270and asecond frame portion272may be rotated relative to each other. As explained above, when thenext keyway76ainend wall26is encountered, thepush pin46essentially snaps outwardly due to the spring biasing so thatkeys74engagekeyways76ato define a secured position. Such apivot mechanism10allows thetricycle210to be converted between various desired positions in a quick, reliable, and easy manner. Moreover, thepivot mechanism10discussed above is believed to overcome many of the shortcomings of pivot mechanisms used in existing convertible tricycles. By way of example, the design is relatively low cost, relatively simple and minimizes or eliminates sharp edges and potential pinch points.

While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in some detail, it is not the intention of the inventor to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. For example, while the improved features disclosed herein have been described in the context of scooters and tricycles, it should be recognized that many of these features may be beneficial to bicycles and possibly other vehicles, or other components associated with these vehicles and therefore, aspects of the invention should not be limited to being applicable to only scooters and tricycles. Thus, the various features of the invention may be used alone or in any combination depending on the needs and preferences of the user.
