DESCRIPTION:
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRobert Plath, an airline pilot, is generally credited with inventing the modern style rolling suitcase. Plath is the inventor of U.S. Pat. No. 4,995,487, which discloses a luggage assembly comprising a suitcase having integrally connected thereto a laterally extendable handle at its upper end and a wheel assembly (usually a pair of wheels) at its lower end. To effect transport, the handle is moved from a lowered, compact, position to a raised position and the suitcase is tilted from an upright standing position to a canted position in which it is supported solely by its wheels and rolled by pulling said handle. An attachment allows for additional luggage items to be carried by the assembly and transported in a fully balanced manner. This type of rolling suitcase is sold, e.g., under the trademark RollaboardÂ® by Travelpro International, Inc.In a variation of this concept, so-called âspinnerâ suitcases include four wheels at the lower (usually smaller) end. Spinner suitcases are designed for the four wheels to remain level, in contact with the ground or floor and be free spinning, not to be tilted and rolled like two wheeled rolling suitcases.Rolling luggage is convenient if one is using only a single suitcase or one rolling suitcase and a smaller bag, e.g., a laptop case, that can be carried on top of and attached to the rolling suitcase. However, rolling suitcases become inconvenient when one is traveling with two or more larger suitcases.Various proposals have been made for combination rolling carts and suitcases. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,720,656 discloses combination rolling cart and suitcase that includes a base suitcase, an external support frame, a plurality of steel stabilizers, a plurality of permanent adjustable straps and plurality of attachment points where the attachment points receive and removably couple the permanent adjustable straps to secure one or more suitcases across a top portion of the combination rolling cart and suitcase. The combination rolling cart and suitcase also includes a pair of telescoping handles, a telescoping stem, a releasable handle lock, a plurality of omnidirectional casters and a lid releasably fastened to the base suitcase.In the various combination rolling cart and suitcase proposals, three or four wheels are installed on the large bottom face of the suitcase. However, having the three or four wheels exposed on the bottom face of the suitcase poses problems for stacking the suitcases in modern airline cargo holds. Therefore, a number of such proposals have complicated arrangements for retracting some or all of the wheels within the bottom face of the suitcase. These disadvantages are likely why such proposals have not been commercially popular.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is therefore still desirable to have a modern style rolling suitcase, either of the two-wheeled tilt and rolling type or of the four wheeled spinner type, which can easily be converted into a suitcase cart, but does not have the disadvantage of having permanently installed wheels on its bottom face and/or have the disadvantage of a complicated wheel retraction mechanism.Therefore, the present invention provides a suitcase including a kit to convert the suitcase to a luggage cart. The suitcase includes a suitcase base having a major bottom wall, opposing front side and rear side walls and opposing top and bottom end walls, the major bottom wall, the front side wall, rear side wall, top end wall and bottom end wall together forming a luggage compartment. A suitcase lid is operably connected to the suitcase base, the suitcase lid having a closed position closing the luggage compartment and an open position allowing access to the luggage compartment in the suitcase base. At least one pair of wheels extends from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base configured to allow the suitcase to be rolled in an upright position with the bottom end parallel to the ground or in a position with the top end tilted toward the user such that the bottom end is tilted from parallel. At least three sockets are installed in spaced relation in the major bottom wall of the suitcase base and open to an outside of the suitcase and at least three stem casters are also provided, each stem caster having a wheel rotatable in a housing and a stem attached to the housing, each stem being configured to be removably secured in one of the at least three sockets. When the at least three stem casters are secured in the at least three sockets and the bottom wall of the suitcase base is arranged facing the ground with the wheels of the at least three stem casters touching the ground, the suitcase is useable as a luggage cart by piling at least one further suitcase over the suitcase lid.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1is a partially cut-away perspective view of one embodiment of the suitcase and kit of the present invention.FIG. 2is another partially cut-away perspective view of one embodiment of the suitcase and kit of the present invention.FIG. 3is a plan view of one embodiment of the suitcase of the present invention showing the major bottom wall.FIG. 4Ais side and partial cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a socket and caster of the present invention in the assembled position;FIG. 4Bis side and partial cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a socket and caster of the present invention in the unassembled position.FIG. 5is a schematic view of one embodiment of the suitcase and kit of the present invention in use.FIG. 6is a schematic view of another embodiment of the suitcase and kit of the present invention in use.FIG. 7is a schematic view showing an adjustable length strap to be connected to a connector attached to one side of the suitcase.FIG. 8is a partially cut-away top plan view of an inside of the luggage compartment of one embodiment of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe present invention provides a suitcase including a kit to convert the suitcase to a luggage cart. The suitcase includes a suitcase base having a major bottom wall, opposing front side and rear side walls and opposing top and bottom end walls, the major bottom wall, the front side wall, rear side wall, top end wall and bottom end wall together forming a luggage compartment. A suitcase lid is operably connected to the suitcase base, the suitcase lid having a closed position closing the luggage compartment and an open position allowing access to the luggage compartment in the suitcase base. At least one pair of wheels extends from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base configured to allow the suitcase to be rolled in an upright position with the bottom end parallel to the ground or in a position with the top end tilted toward the user such that the bottom end is tilted from parallel. Thus, with one pair of wheels extending from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base, the suitcase, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its basically upright position as a two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase. Similarly, with two pair of spinner-type wheels extending from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base, the suitcase, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its upright position as a the four wheeled spinner type suitcase.At least three (preferably four) sockets are installed in spaced relation in the major bottom wall of the suitcase base and open to an outside of the suitcase and at least three (preferably four) stem casters are also provided, each stem caster having a wheel rotatable in a housing and a stem attached to the housing, each stem being configured to be removably secured in one of the at least three sockets. When the at least three (preferably four) stem casters are secured in the at least three (preferably four) sockets and the bottom wall of the suitcase base is arranged facing the ground with the wheels of the at least three stem (preferably four) casters touching the ground, the suitcase is useable as a luggage cart by piling at least one further suitcase over the suitcase lid.FIGS. 1 and 2are partially cut-away perspective views of one embodiment of the suitcase and kit of the present invention (showing opposite sides of the suitcase) andFIG. 3is a plan view of one embodiment of the suitcase of the present invention showing the major bottom wall. As shown inFIGS. 1-3, Thesuitcase10in this embodiment includes a suitcase base having amajor bottom wall12, opposingfront side wall14andrear side wall16and opposingtop end wall18andbottom end wall20, themajor bottom wall12, thefront side wall14,rear side wall16,top end wall18andbottom end wall20together forming a luggage compartment22(seeFIG. 8). Asuitcase lid24is operably connected to the suitcase base, thesuitcase lid24having a closed position (e.g., by means of a zipper26) closing theluggage compartment22and an open position (not shown) allowing access to theluggage compartment22in the suitcase base. Thesuitcase10in this embodiment is an improved two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase. That is, thesuitcase10has one pair ofwheels28extending from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base, thesuitcase10, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its basically upright position as a two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase.In the embodiment shown, thesuitcase10includes aretractable handle30as is known in the art having a retracted position with the handle being substantially flush with the top end wall as shown in the figures and an extended position with the handle extending away from the top end wall such that the handle can be used for pulling the suitcase with the top end tilted toward the user as is known in the art. An example of a suitcase having ahandle30â² in an extended position with the handle extending away from the top end wall, as is known in the art, is shown for example in connection with the top suitcase inFIG. 5.In another embodiment, as shown in connection with thesuitcase10â² shown inFIG. 6, two pair of spinner-type wheels28â² extend from thebottom end wall20of the suitcase base. In this embodiment, thesuitcase10â², when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its upright position as a four wheeled spinner type suitcase as is known in the art.Thesuitcase10may also have one or morefixed handles32on itstop end wall18or32â² on its front side wall14(see, e.g.,FIG. 2).Thesuitcase10or10â² of the present invention is modified and improved from, respectively, a typical two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase or a four wheeled spinner type suitcase. As most clearly shown inFIGS. 1 and 3, thesuitcase10includes at least three (preferably four as shown in this embodiment)sockets34installed in spaced relation (adjacent the four corners in the embodiment shown) in themajor bottom wall12of the suitcase base and open to an outside of thesuitcase10. At least three (preferably four in this embodiment)stem casters36are also provided. Thestem casters36can be stored in any convenient location when not in use, including but not limited to in thesuitcase10itself or in, e.g., apocket38shown in cut-away view in thelid24. As more clearly shown inFIGS. 4A and 4B, eachstem caster36has awheel40rotatable in ahousing42and astem44attached to thehousing42, eachstem44being configured to be removably secured in one of the at least three (preferably four)sockets34as is known in the caster and housing art. For example and without limitation, as is known in the caster and housing art, thecaster stem44can be removably secured in thesocket34of the socket mount by use of an expanding adapter, a friction ring, a grip neck or by being threaded in thesocket34.When the at least three (preferably four)stem casters36are secured in the at least three (preferably four)sockets34and the bottom wall of the suitcase base is arranged facing theground4with thewheels40of the at least three stem (preferably four)casters36touching the ground, the suitcase is useable as a luggage cart by piling at least onefurther suitcase1,2,3over thesuitcase lid24as shown inFIGS. 5 and 6. The further suitcases may be any type of suitcase, i.e., possibly, but not necessarily a suitcase of the present invention. One, two, three or four, by way of example, further suitcases may be stacked on thesuitcase10or10â² of the present invention in its position as a luggage cart.Anadjustable length strap46may be provided to secure thefurther suitcases1,2,3over thesuitcase lid24of the suitcase of the present invention. Thestrap46can be made of any material having sufficient strength to secure the further suitcases and can be a bungee-type strap or a canvas-type strap, the length of which can be adjusted withadjustment clips48as shown in the figures. When not in use, thestrap46can be stored in thesuitcase10, e.g., in apocket50provided on thesuitcase10external to the luggage compartment. In the embodiment shown, the suitcase includesconnectors52attached to opposing sides of the suitcase configured to connect, e.g., by male and female clips, to ends of theadjustable length strap46.In one embodiment shown inFIG. 6, aflexible strap54may be provided and may be connectable to at least one of the top end and the bottom end of the suitcase e.g., to ring56. Theflexible strap54is configured to be used to pull thesuitcase10or10â² when it is being used as a luggage cart.It is also possible to use the handle, e.g., aretractable handle30â² of one of thefurther suitcases1,2,3, as shown inFIG. 5, to push or pull the stacked suitcases.The bottom12of the suitcase is strengthened to receive thesockets34andcasters36and to support the further suitcase(s)1,2,3that will be stacked on thesuitcase10or10â² in the luggage cart position. For example, as shown in the embodiment ofFIG. 8, which is a partially cut-away top plan view of an inside of theluggage compartment22of the present invention, two rigid orsemi-rigid reinforcement pieces58,60can be installed to receive and support thesockets34. Different size casters and sockets may be used and, if desired, the opposing front side and rear side walls and opposing top and bottom end walls may be strengthened to support heavier stacked further suitcases.The number of suitcases that can be stacked on the suitcase of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the suitcase of the present invention is strengthened as noted above to support heavier stacked further suitcases. In the embodiments shown inFIGS. 5 and 6, three additional suitcases are shown stacked on the suitcase of the present invention. With three suitcases stacked on the suitcase of the present invention, one can still see over the top of the stack if pushing the suitcases. Of course, more suitcases can be stacked on the suitcase of the present invention, especially if pulling the suitcases, and of course less than three additional suitcases, i.e., one or two could also be stacked on the suitcase of the present invention.Thus, the suitcase of the present invention, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its basically upright position as a two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase or a four-wheeled spinner type suitcase. However, by including a kit comprising at least three casters, the suitcase of the present invention can be converted to a luggage cart. The kit may but does not necessarily also include an adjustable strap for securing further suitcases on the suitcase of the present invention in its luggage cart position and/or a flexible strap connectable to at least one of the top end and the bottom end of the suitcase and configured to be used to pull the suitcase when it is being used as a luggage cart.

This type of rolling suitcase is sold, e.g., under the trademark RollaboardÂ® by Travelpro International, Inc.

In a variation of this concept, so-called âspinnerâ suitcases include four wheels at the lower (usually smaller) end. Spinner suitcases are designed for the four wheels to remain level, in contact with the ground or floor and be free spinning, not to be tilted and rolled like two wheeled rolling suitcases.

Rolling luggage is convenient if one is using only a single suitcase or one rolling suitcase and a smaller bag, e.g., a laptop case, that can be carried on top of and attached to the rolling suitcase. However, rolling suitcases become inconvenient when one is traveling with two or more larger suitcases.

Various proposals have been made for combination rolling carts and suitcases. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,720,656 discloses combination rolling cart and suitcase that includes a base suitcase, an external support frame, a plurality of steel stabilizers, a plurality of permanent adjustable straps and plurality of attachment points where the attachment points receive and removably couple the permanent adjustable straps to secure one or more suitcases across a top portion of the combination rolling cart and suitcase. The combination rolling cart and suitcase also includes a pair of telescoping handles, a telescoping stem, a releasable handle lock, a plurality of omnidirectional casters and a lid releasably fastened to the base suitcase.

In the various combination rolling cart and suitcase proposals, three or four wheels are installed on the large bottom face of the suitcase. However, having the three or four wheels exposed on the bottom face of the suitcase poses problems for stacking the suitcases in modern airline cargo holds. Therefore, a number of such proposals have complicated arrangements for retracting some or all of the wheels within the bottom face of the suitcase. These disadvantages are likely why such proposals have not been commercially popular.

It is therefore still desirable to have a modern style rolling suitcase, either of the two-wheeled tilt and rolling type or of the four wheeled spinner type, which can easily be converted into a suitcase cart, but does not have the disadvantage of having permanently installed wheels on its bottom face and/or have the disadvantage of a complicated wheel retraction mechanism.

Therefore, the present invention provides a suitcase including a kit to convert the suitcase to a luggage cart. The suitcase includes a suitcase base having a major bottom wall, opposing front side and rear side walls and opposing top and bottom end walls, the major bottom wall, the front side wall, rear side wall, top end wall and bottom end wall together forming a luggage compartment. A suitcase lid is operably connected to the suitcase base, the suitcase lid having a closed position closing the luggage compartment and an open position allowing access to the luggage compartment in the suitcase base. At least one pair of wheels extends from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base configured to allow the suitcase to be rolled in an upright position with the bottom end parallel to the ground or in a position with the top end tilted toward the user such that the bottom end is tilted from parallel. At least three sockets are installed in spaced relation in the major bottom wall of the suitcase base and open to an outside of the suitcase and at least three stem casters are also provided, each stem caster having a wheel rotatable in a housing and a stem attached to the housing, each stem being configured to be removably secured in one of the at least three sockets. When the at least three stem casters are secured in the at least three sockets and the bottom wall of the suitcase base is arranged facing the ground with the wheels of the at least three stem casters touching the ground, the suitcase is useable as a luggage cart by piling at least one further suitcase over the suitcase lid.

The present invention provides a suitcase including a kit to convert the suitcase to a luggage cart. The suitcase includes a suitcase base having a major bottom wall, opposing front side and rear side walls and opposing top and bottom end walls, the major bottom wall, the front side wall, rear side wall, top end wall and bottom end wall together forming a luggage compartment. A suitcase lid is operably connected to the suitcase base, the suitcase lid having a closed position closing the luggage compartment and an open position allowing access to the luggage compartment in the suitcase base. At least one pair of wheels extends from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base configured to allow the suitcase to be rolled in an upright position with the bottom end parallel to the ground or in a position with the top end tilted toward the user such that the bottom end is tilted from parallel. Thus, with one pair of wheels extending from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base, the suitcase, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its basically upright position as a two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase. Similarly, with two pair of spinner-type wheels extending from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base, the suitcase, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its upright position as a the four wheeled spinner type suitcase.

At least three (preferably four) sockets are installed in spaced relation in the major bottom wall of the suitcase base and open to an outside of the suitcase and at least three (preferably four) stem casters are also provided, each stem caster having a wheel rotatable in a housing and a stem attached to the housing, each stem being configured to be removably secured in one of the at least three sockets. When the at least three (preferably four) stem casters are secured in the at least three (preferably four) sockets and the bottom wall of the suitcase base is arranged facing the ground with the wheels of the at least three stem (preferably four) casters touching the ground, the suitcase is useable as a luggage cart by piling at least one further suitcase over the suitcase lid.

FIGS. 1 and 2are partially cut-away perspective views of one embodiment of the suitcase and kit of the present invention (showing opposite sides of the suitcase) andFIG. 3is a plan view of one embodiment of the suitcase of the present invention showing the major bottom wall. As shown inFIGS. 1-3, Thesuitcase10in this embodiment includes a suitcase base having amajor bottom wall12, opposingfront side wall14andrear side wall16and opposingtop end wall18andbottom end wall20, themajor bottom wall12, thefront side wall14,rear side wall16,top end wall18andbottom end wall20together forming a luggage compartment22(seeFIG. 8). Asuitcase lid24is operably connected to the suitcase base, thesuitcase lid24having a closed position (e.g., by means of a zipper26) closing theluggage compartment22and an open position (not shown) allowing access to theluggage compartment22in the suitcase base. Thesuitcase10in this embodiment is an improved two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase. That is, thesuitcase10has one pair ofwheels28extending from the bottom end wall of the suitcase base, thesuitcase10, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its basically upright position as a two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase.

In the embodiment shown, thesuitcase10includes aretractable handle30as is known in the art having a retracted position with the handle being substantially flush with the top end wall as shown in the figures and an extended position with the handle extending away from the top end wall such that the handle can be used for pulling the suitcase with the top end tilted toward the user as is known in the art. An example of a suitcase having ahandle30â² in an extended position with the handle extending away from the top end wall, as is known in the art, is shown for example in connection with the top suitcase inFIG. 5.

In another embodiment, as shown in connection with thesuitcase10â² shown inFIG. 6, two pair of spinner-type wheels28â² extend from thebottom end wall20of the suitcase base. In this embodiment, thesuitcase10â², when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its upright position as a four wheeled spinner type suitcase as is known in the art.

Thesuitcase10may also have one or morefixed handles32on itstop end wall18or32â² on its front side wall14(see, e.g.,FIG. 2).

Thesuitcase10or10â² of the present invention is modified and improved from, respectively, a typical two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase or a four wheeled spinner type suitcase. As most clearly shown inFIGS. 1 and 3, thesuitcase10includes at least three (preferably four as shown in this embodiment)sockets34installed in spaced relation (adjacent the four corners in the embodiment shown) in themajor bottom wall12of the suitcase base and open to an outside of thesuitcase10. At least three (preferably four in this embodiment)stem casters36are also provided. Thestem casters36can be stored in any convenient location when not in use, including but not limited to in thesuitcase10itself or in, e.g., apocket38shown in cut-away view in thelid24. As more clearly shown inFIGS. 4A and 4B, eachstem caster36has awheel40rotatable in ahousing42and astem44attached to thehousing42, eachstem44being configured to be removably secured in one of the at least three (preferably four)sockets34as is known in the caster and housing art. For example and without limitation, as is known in the caster and housing art, thecaster stem44can be removably secured in thesocket34of the socket mount by use of an expanding adapter, a friction ring, a grip neck or by being threaded in thesocket34.

When the at least three (preferably four)stem casters36are secured in the at least three (preferably four)sockets34and the bottom wall of the suitcase base is arranged facing theground4with thewheels40of the at least three stem (preferably four)casters36touching the ground, the suitcase is useable as a luggage cart by piling at least onefurther suitcase1,2,3over thesuitcase lid24as shown inFIGS. 5 and 6. The further suitcases may be any type of suitcase, i.e., possibly, but not necessarily a suitcase of the present invention. One, two, three or four, by way of example, further suitcases may be stacked on thesuitcase10or10â² of the present invention in its position as a luggage cart.

Anadjustable length strap46may be provided to secure thefurther suitcases1,2,3over thesuitcase lid24of the suitcase of the present invention. Thestrap46can be made of any material having sufficient strength to secure the further suitcases and can be a bungee-type strap or a canvas-type strap, the length of which can be adjusted withadjustment clips48as shown in the figures. When not in use, thestrap46can be stored in thesuitcase10, e.g., in apocket50provided on thesuitcase10external to the luggage compartment. In the embodiment shown, the suitcase includesconnectors52attached to opposing sides of the suitcase configured to connect, e.g., by male and female clips, to ends of theadjustable length strap46.

In one embodiment shown inFIG. 6, aflexible strap54may be provided and may be connectable to at least one of the top end and the bottom end of the suitcase e.g., to ring56. Theflexible strap54is configured to be used to pull thesuitcase10or10â² when it is being used as a luggage cart.

It is also possible to use the handle, e.g., aretractable handle30â² of one of thefurther suitcases1,2,3, as shown inFIG. 5, to push or pull the stacked suitcases.

The bottom12of the suitcase is strengthened to receive thesockets34andcasters36and to support the further suitcase(s)1,2,3that will be stacked on thesuitcase10or10â² in the luggage cart position. For example, as shown in the embodiment ofFIG. 8, which is a partially cut-away top plan view of an inside of theluggage compartment22of the present invention, two rigid orsemi-rigid reinforcement pieces58,60can be installed to receive and support thesockets34. Different size casters and sockets may be used and, if desired, the opposing front side and rear side walls and opposing top and bottom end walls may be strengthened to support heavier stacked further suitcases.

The number of suitcases that can be stacked on the suitcase of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the suitcase of the present invention is strengthened as noted above to support heavier stacked further suitcases. In the embodiments shown inFIGS. 5 and 6, three additional suitcases are shown stacked on the suitcase of the present invention. With three suitcases stacked on the suitcase of the present invention, one can still see over the top of the stack if pushing the suitcases. Of course, more suitcases can be stacked on the suitcase of the present invention, especially if pulling the suitcases, and of course less than three additional suitcases, i.e., one or two could also be stacked on the suitcase of the present invention.

Thus, the suitcase of the present invention, when not being used as a luggage cart, is still operational in its basically upright position as a two-wheeled tilt and rolling type suitcase or a four-wheeled spinner type suitcase. However, by including a kit comprising at least three casters, the suitcase of the present invention can be converted to a luggage cart. The kit may but does not necessarily also include an adjustable strap for securing further suitcases on the suitcase of the present invention in its luggage cart position and/or a flexible strap connectable to at least one of the top end and the bottom end of the suitcase and configured to be used to pull the suitcase when it is being used as a luggage cart.
