It should be noted that the figures may or may not be drawn to scale and that elements of similar structures or functions are represented by like reference numerals throughout the figures. It should also be noted that the figures are only intended to facilitate the description of the embodiments. They are not intended as an exhaustive description of the invention or as a limitation on the scope of the invention. In addition, an illustrated embodiment needs not have all the aspects or advantages shown. An aspect or an advantage described in conjunction with a particular embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment and can be practiced in any other embodiments even if not so illustrated, or if not so explicitly described.Throughout this disclosure, the words âstomaâ and âostomyâ are used to denote a surgically created opening bypassing the intestines or urinary tract system of a person. The words are used interchangeably, and no differentiated meaning is intended. The same applies for any words or phrases derived from these, e.g. âstomalâ, âostomiesâ etc. Also, the solid and liquid wastes emanating from the stoma may be referred to as both stomal âoutput,â âwaste(s),â and âfluidsâ interchangeably. A subject having undergone ostomy surgery may be referred to as âostomistâ or âostomateââmoreover, also as âpatientâ or âuserâ. However, in some cases âuserâ may also relate or refer to a health care professional (HCP), such as a surgeon or an ostomy care nurse or others. In those cases, it will either be explicitly stated, or be implicit from the context that the âuserâ is not the âpatientâ him- or herself.In the following, whenever referring to proximal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the skin-facing side or surface, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. Likewise, whenever referring to the distal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the side or surface facing away from the skin, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. In other words, the proximal side or surface is the side or surface closest to the user, when the appliance is fitted on a user and the distal side is the opposite side or surfaceâthe side or surface furthest away from the user in use.The axial direction is defined as the direction of the stoma, when a user wears the appliance. Thus, the axial direction is generally perpendicular to the skin or abdominal surface of the user.The radial direction is defined as perpendicular to the axial direction. In some sentences, the words âinnerâ and âouterâ may be used. These qualifiers should generally be perceived with respect to the radial direction, such that a reference to an âouterâ element means that the element is farther away from a centre portion of the ostomy appliance than an element referenced as âinnerâ. In addition, âinnermostâ should be interpreted as the portion of a component forming a centre of the component and/or being adjacent to the centre of the component. In analogy, âoutermostâ should be interpreted as a portion of a component forming an outer edge or outer contour of a component and/or being adjacent to that outer edge or outer contour.The use of the word âsubstantiallyâ as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply mean that any deviations are within tolerances that would normally be expected by the skilled person in the relevant field.The use of the word âgenerallyâ as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply meanâfor a structural feature: that a majority or major portion of such feature exhibits the characteristic in question, andâfor a functional feature or an effect: that a majority of outcomes involving the characteristic provide the effect, but that exceptionally outcomes do no provide the effect.The present disclosure relates to an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices. Further, methods related to the ostomy system and devices thereof are disclosed. An accessory device (also referred to as an external device) may be a mobile phone or other handheld device. An accessory device may be a personal electronic device, e.g. a wearable, such as a watch or other wrist-worn electronic device. An accessory device may be a docking station.

The server device may be operated and/or controlled by the ostomy appliance manufacturer and/or a service centre.The present disclosure provides an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices which either alone or together facilitate reliable determination of the nature, severity and rapidness of moisture propagation in the adhesive material provided for attaching the base plate to the skin surface of a user. Depending on the nature of the pattern of moisture propagation in the adhesive, the ostomy system and devices thereof enable providing information to the user about the type of failure, and in turn enable providing an indication to the user of the severity and thus the remaining time frame for replacing the ostomy appliance without experiencing severe leakage and/or skin damage.The ostomy appliance comprises a base plate and an ostomy pouch (also referred to as an ostomy bag).

It should be noted that the figures may or may not be drawn to scale and that elements of similar structures or functions are represented by like reference numerals throughout the figures. It should also be noted that the figures are only intended to facilitate the description of the embodiments. They are not intended as an exhaustive description of the invention or as a limitation on the scope of the invention. In addition, an illustrated embodiment needs not have all the aspects or advantages shown. An aspect or an advantage described in conjunction with a particular embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment and can be practiced in any other embodiments even if not so illustrated, or if not so explicitly described.Throughout this disclosure, the words âstomaâ and âostomyâ are used to denote a surgically created opening bypassing the intestines or urinary tract system of a person. The words are used interchangeably, and no differentiated meaning is intended. The same applies for any words or phrases derived from these, e.g. âstomalâ, âostomiesâ etc. Also, the solid and liquid wastes emanating from the stoma may be referred to as both stomal âoutput,â âwaste(s),â and âfluidsâ interchangeably. A subject having undergone ostomy surgery may be referred to as âostomistâ or âostomateââmoreover, also as âpatientâ or âuserâ. However, in some cases âuserâ may also relate or refer to a health care professional (HCP), such as a surgeon or an ostomy care nurse or others. In those cases, it will either be explicitly stated, or be implicit from the context that the âuserâ is not the âpatientâ him- or herself.In the following, whenever referring to proximal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the skin-facing side or surface, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. Likewise, whenever referring to the distal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the side or surface facing away from the skin, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. In other words, the proximal side or surface is the side or surface closest to the user, when the appliance is fitted on a user and the distal side is the opposite side or surfaceâthe side or surface furthest away from the user in use.The axial direction is defined as the direction of the stoma, when a user wears the appliance. Thus, the axial direction is generally perpendicular to the skin or abdominal surface of the user.The radial direction is defined as perpendicular to the axial direction. In some sentences, the words âinnerâ and âouterâ may be used. These qualifiers should generally be perceived with respect to the radial direction, such that a reference to an âouterâ element means that the element is farther away from a centre portion of the ostomy appliance than an element referenced as âinnerâ. In addition, âinnermostâ should be interpreted as the portion of a component forming a centre of the component and/or being adjacent to the centre of the component. In analogy, âoutermostâ should be interpreted as a portion of a component forming an outer edge or outer contour of a component and/or being adjacent to that outer edge or outer contour.The use of the word âsubstantiallyâ as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply mean that any deviations are within tolerances that would normally be expected by the skilled person in the relevant field.The use of the word âgenerallyâ as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply meanâfor a structural feature: that a majority or major portion of such feature exhibits the characteristic in question, andâfor a functional feature or an effect: that a majority of outcomes involving the characteristic provide the effect, but that exceptionally outcomes do no provide the effect.The present disclosure relates to an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices. Further, methods related to the ostomy system and devices thereof are disclosed. An accessory device (also referred to as an external device) may be a mobile phone or other handheld device. An accessory device may be a personal electronic device, e.g. a wearable, such as a watch or other wrist-worn electronic device. An accessory device may be a docking station. The docking station may be configured to electrically and/or mechanically couple the monitor device to the docking station. The docking station may be configured for charging the monitor device and/or configured for transferring data between the monitor device and the docking station. The ostomy system may comprise a server device. The server device may be operated and/or controlled by the ostomy appliance manufacturer and/or a service centre.The present disclosure provides an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices which either alone or together facilitate reliable determination of the nature, severity and rapidness of moisture propagation in the adhesive material provided for attaching the base plate to the skin surface of a user. Depending on the nature of the pattern of moisture propagation in the adhesive, the ostomy system and devices thereof enable providing information to the user about the type of failure, and in turn enable providing an indication to the user of the severity and thus the remaining time frame for replacing the ostomy appliance without experiencing severe leakage and/or skin damage.The ostomy appliance comprises a base plate and an ostomy pouch (also referred to as an ostomy bag). The ostomy appliance may be a colostomy appliance, an ileostomy appliance or a urostomy appliance.

Further, a two-part ostomy appliance may facilitate correct application of the base plate to skin, e.g. to an improved user sight of the stomal region. The ostomy appliance may be a one-part ostomy appliance, i.e. the base plate and the ostomy pouch may be fixedly attached to each other.

Although not illustrated, theelectrode assembly204may comprise areinforcement element308, e.g. as illustrated inFIGS.15and16. Thus, thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700ofFIG.17may correspond to thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700, respectively, ofFIGS.15and16.Thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204, together with thetop layer208and the optional second adhesive layer, has been turned over to expose theconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216on a distal side of thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700. Thus, the primary side of thefirst part302initially being a proximal side (as shown inFIG.15) is, after thefirst part302has been turned, facing distally.FIG.18, shows a sectional schematic representation of part of abase plate4and/or asensor assembly part700as shown inFIG.17, wherein thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700comprises acoupling part210. Thecoupling part210is configured for forming a mechanical connection between the monitor device and thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700. Thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204is extending into thecoupling part210, e.g. to allow the monitor device, such as terminals of the monitor device to connect to theelectrodes216of thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700. Thecoupling part210is positioned to cover theconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216. Thecoupling part210may be attached to thetop layer208and/or thecoupling part210may be attached to theelectrode assembly204.FIG.19shows a flowchart of anexemplary method1000, such as a method for manufacturing a base plate or a sensor assembly part for an ostomy appliance.

Various exemplary embodiments and details are described hereinafter, with reference to the figures when relevant. It should be noted that the figures may or may not be drawn to scale and that elements of similar structures or functions are represented by like reference numerals throughout the figures. It should also be noted that the figures are only intended to facilitate the description of the embodiments. They are not intended as an exhaustive description of the invention or as a limitation on the scope of the invention. In addition, an illustrated embodiment needs not have all the aspects or advantages shown. An aspect or an advantage described in conjunction with a particular embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment and can be practiced in any other embodiments even if not so illustrated, or if not so explicitly described.

Throughout this disclosure, the words âstomaâ and âostomyâ are used to denote a surgically created opening bypassing the intestines or urinary tract system of a person. The words are used interchangeably, and no differentiated meaning is intended. The same applies for any words or phrases derived from these, e.g. âstomalâ, âostomiesâ etc. Also, the solid and liquid wastes emanating from the stoma may be referred to as both stomal âoutput,â âwaste(s),â and âfluidsâ interchangeably. A subject having undergone ostomy surgery may be referred to as âostomistâ or âostomateââmoreover, also as âpatientâ or âuserâ. However, in some cases âuserâ may also relate or refer to a health care professional (HCP), such as a surgeon or an ostomy care nurse or others. In those cases, it will either be explicitly stated, or be implicit from the context that the âuserâ is not the âpatientâ him- or herself.

In the following, whenever referring to proximal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the skin-facing side or surface, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. Likewise, whenever referring to the distal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the side or surface facing away from the skin, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. In other words, the proximal side or surface is the side or surface closest to the user, when the appliance is fitted on a user and the distal side is the opposite side or surfaceâthe side or surface furthest away from the user in use.

The axial direction is defined as the direction of the stoma, when a user wears the appliance. Thus, the axial direction is generally perpendicular to the skin or abdominal surface of the user.

The radial direction is defined as perpendicular to the axial direction. In some sentences, the words âinnerâ and âouterâ may be used. These qualifiers should generally be perceived with respect to the radial direction, such that a reference to an âouterâ element means that the element is farther away from a centre portion of the ostomy appliance than an element referenced as âinnerâ. In addition, âinnermostâ should be interpreted as the portion of a component forming a centre of the component and/or being adjacent to the centre of the component. In analogy, âoutermostâ should be interpreted as a portion of a component forming an outer edge or outer contour of a component and/or being adjacent to that outer edge or outer contour.

The use of the word âsubstantiallyâ as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply mean that any deviations are within tolerances that would normally be expected by the skilled person in the relevant field.

The use of the word âgenerallyâ as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply meanâfor a structural feature: that a majority or major portion of such feature exhibits the characteristic in question, andâfor a functional feature or an effect: that a majority of outcomes involving the characteristic provide the effect, but that exceptionally outcomes do no provide the effect.

The present disclosure relates to an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices. Further, methods related to the ostomy system and devices thereof are disclosed. An accessory device (also referred to as an external device) may be a mobile phone or other handheld device. An accessory device may be a personal electronic device, e.g. a wearable, such as a watch or other wrist-worn electronic device. An accessory device may be a docking station. The docking station may be configured to electrically and/or mechanically couple the monitor device to the docking station. The docking station may be configured for charging the monitor device and/or configured for transferring data between the monitor device and the docking station. The ostomy system may comprise a server device. The server device may be operated and/or controlled by the ostomy appliance manufacturer and/or a service centre.

The present disclosure provides an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices which either alone or together facilitate reliable determination of the nature, severity and rapidness of moisture propagation in the adhesive material provided for attaching the base plate to the skin surface of a user. Depending on the nature of the pattern of moisture propagation in the adhesive, the ostomy system and devices thereof enable providing information to the user about the type of failure, and in turn enable providing an indication to the user of the severity and thus the remaining time frame for replacing the ostomy appliance without experiencing severe leakage and/or skin damage.

The ostomy appliance comprises a base plate and an ostomy pouch (also referred to as an ostomy bag). The ostomy appliance may be a colostomy appliance, an ileostomy appliance or a urostomy appliance. The ostomy appliance may be a two-part ostomy appliance, i.e. the base plate and the ostomy pouch may be releasably coupled e.g. with a mechanical and/or an adhesive coupling, e.g. to allow that a plurality of ostomy pouches can be utilized (exchanged) with one base plate. Further, a two-part ostomy appliance may facilitate correct application of the base plate to skin, e.g. to an improved user sight of the stomal region. The ostomy appliance may be a one-part ostomy appliance, i.e. the base plate and the ostomy pouch may be fixedly attached to each other. The base plate is configured for coupling to a user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma, such as a peristomal skin area.

The ostomy appliance includes a base plate, such as a monolithic, one-piece base plate, e.g. integrated with a sensor assembly part, or a base plate and a separate sensor assembly part, such as a sensor assembly part to be subsequently applied to a base plate. For example, to allow an arbitrary base plate, such as a conventional base plate, to achieve the features as described herein. Features as described with respect to the base plate herein may be provided by a sensor assembly part to be applied to a base plate, e.g. by the user. A sensor assembly part may be adapted to adhere to an ostomy plate.

A disclosed method of attaching a base plate to a user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma, such as the peristomal skin area, may comprise attaching a sensor assembly part to a base plate and attaching the base plate, e.g. together with the attached sensor assembly part, to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma, such as the peristomal skin area. Alternatively, the method of attaching the base plate to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma may comprise attaching the sensor assembly part to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma and attaching the base plate to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma above the attached sensor assembly part.

The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part comprises a first adhesive layer, also denoted center adhesive layer. During use, the first adhesive layer adheres to the user's skin (peristomal area) and/or to additional seals, such as sealing paste, sealing tape and/or sealing ring. Thus, the first adhesive layer may be configured for attachment of the base plate and/or the sensor assembly part to the skin surface of a user. The first adhesive layer may have a stomal opening, such as a first adhesive stomal opening, with a center point.

The first adhesive layer may be made of a first composition. The first composition may comprise one or more polyisobutenes and/or styrene-isoprene-styrene.

The first composition may comprise one or more polybutenes, one or more styrene copolymers, one or more hydrocolloids, or any combination thereof. The combination of the adhesive properties of the polybutenes and the absorbing properties of the hydrocolloids renders the first composition suitable for use in ostomy appliances. The styrene copolymer may for example be a styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer or a styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer. Preferably, one or more styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block type copolymers are employed. The amount of styrene block-copolymer may be from 5% to 20% of the total adhesive composition. The butene component is suitably a conjugated butadiene polymer selected from polybutadiene, polyisoprene. The polybutenes are preferably present in an amount of from 35-50% of the total adhesive composition. Preferably, the polybutene is polyisobutylene (PIB). Suitable hydrocolloids for incorporation in the first composition are selected from naturally occurring hydrocolloids, semisynthetic hydrocolloids and synthetic hydrocolloids. The first composition may comprise 20-60% hydrocolloids. A preferred hydrocolloid is carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The first composition may optionally contain other components, such as fillers, tackifiers, plasticizers, and other additives.

The first adhesive layer may have a substantially uniform thickness. The first adhesive layer may have a thickness in the range from 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm, e.g. in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.2 mm.

The first adhesive layer may have a primary thickness in a primary part of the first adhesive layer, e.g. in a primary region within a primary radial distance or in a primary radial distance range from the center point of the stomal opening. The primary thickness may be in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.5 mm. such as about 1.0 mm. The primary radial distance may be in the range from 20 mm to 50 mm, such as in the range from 25 mm to 35 mm, e.g. 30 mm.

The first adhesive layer may have a secondary thickness in a secondary part of the first adhesive layer, e.g. in a secondary region outside a secondary radial distance or in a secondary radial distance range from the center point of the stomal opening. The secondary thickness may be in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm, such as about 0.5 mm. The secondary radial distance may be in the range from 20 mm to 50 mm, such as in the range from 25 mm to 35 mm, e.g. 30 mm.

The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part may comprise a second layer. The second layer may be a second adhesive layer, also denoted rim adhesive layer. The second layer may have a second radial extension that is larger than a first radial extension of the first adhesive layer at least in a first angular range of the base plate and/or the sensor assembly part. Accordingly, a part of a proximal surface of the second layer may be configured for attachment to the skin surface of a user. The part of a proximal surface of the second layer configured for attachment to the skin surface of a user is also denoted the skin attachment surface of the second adhesive layer. The second layer may have a stomal opening, such as a second layer stomal opening and/or a second adhesive stomal opening, with a center point.

The second adhesive layer may be made of a second composition. The second composition may comprise one or more polyisobutenes and/or styrene-isoprene-styrene. The second composition may comprise one or more hydrocolloids. The second composition may comprise one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids.

Thebase plate4optionally comprises a secondadhesive layer202, also denoted rim adhesive layer. Thebase plate4comprises a plurality ofelectrodes216arranged in anelectrode assembly204. Theelectrode assembly204is arranged between the firstadhesive layer200and the secondadhesive layer202. Theelectrode assembly204optionally comprises asupport layer214. The electrodes may be formed on a proximal side of thesupport layer214, such as by printing of conductive ink on the proximal side of thesupport layer214. Theelectrode assembly204optionally comprises amasking element218, e.g. covering or overlapping with parts of theelectrodes216when seen in the axial direction, e.g. from a proximal side of the electrodes. The electrode assembly has afirst part302comprisingconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216. The electrode assembly has asecond part303. Thesecond part303comprises sensing parts of the plurality ofelectrodes216. Thebase plate4comprises arelease liner206. Thebase plate4comprises atop layer208.

The maskingelement218may be configured not to cover or overlap the connectingparts217of the plurality of electrodes.

In someexemplary electrode assembly204, such as theelectrode assembly204ofFIG.12, theelectrode assembly204comprises areinforcement element308. Thereinforcement element308may be positioned proximal to theelectrode assembly216, such as proximal to the plurality ofelectrodes216, such as proximal to the plurality ofconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216.

Thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700comprises a firstadhesive layer200, an optional secondadhesive layer202, and atop layer208. Anelectrode assembly204comprising a plurality ofelectrodes216is arranged between the firstadhesive layer200and thetop layer208, such as between the firstadhesive layer200and the secondadhesive layer202. For example, a second part of theelectrode assembly204is arranged between the firstadhesive layer200and the secondadhesive layer202and/or thetop layer208. Theelectrode assembly204further comprises anoptional reinforcement element308and anoptional release liner206.

The firstadhesive layer200is provided such that it does not cover a primary side of afirst part302of theelectrode assembly204. For example, therelease liner206comprises a firstelevated part314such as to facilitate the formation of the firstadhesive layer202to not cover the primary side of thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204. The primary side of thefirst part302may be a proximal side of thefirst part302. Thefirst part302includes the connection parts of the plurality ofelectrodes216and thereinforcement element308or part of thereinforcement element308.

Alternatively, therelease liner206may be removed so thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204is accessible from a proximal side.

Because the firstadhesive layer200is not covering thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204, thefirst part302is not adhered to the release liner or any other proximally positioned layers. Therefore, theconnection parts217may be accessible, e.g. for connection with a monitor device. Connection to theconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216may be provided through thereinforcement element308, or theconnection parts217may be formed by conductive paths of thereinforcement element308.

Thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700comprises a firstadhesive layer200, an optional secondadhesive layer202, and atop layer208. Anelectrode assembly204comprising a plurality ofelectrodes216is arranged between the firstadhesive layer200and thetop layer208, such as between the firstadhesive layer200and the secondadhesive layer202. For example, a second part of theelectrode assembly204is arranged between the first adhesive layer and the secondadhesive layer202/thetop layer208. Although not illustrated, theelectrode assembly204may comprise areinforcement element308, e.g. as illustrated inFIGS.15and16. Thus, thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700ofFIG.17may correspond to thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700, respectively, ofFIGS.15and16.

Thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204, together with thetop layer208and the optional second adhesive layer, has been turned over to expose theconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216on a distal side of thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700.

Thefirst part302of theelectrode assembly204is extending into thecoupling part210, e.g. to allow the monitor device, such as terminals of the monitor device to connect to theelectrodes216of thebase plate4and/or thesensor assembly part700. Thecoupling part210is positioned to cover theconnection parts217of the plurality ofelectrodes216.
