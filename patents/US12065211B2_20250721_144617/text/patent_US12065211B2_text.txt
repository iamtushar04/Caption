CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application entitled âBICYCLE FRAM FOR AN E-BIKE,â Ser. No. 17/098,925, filed Nov. 16, 2020, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled âE-BIKE WITH CONCEALED BATTERY,â Ser. No. 62/937,571, filed Nov. 19, 2019, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated entirely herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to bicycle frames for electric and/or electric-assist bicycles, and particularly to a bicycle frame with a battery that is fully concealed within the frame of the bicycle.State of the ArtAn electric bicycle, also known as an e-bike, is a bicycle with an integrated electric motor powered by a battery, which can be used for partial propulsion, while retaining the ability to be pedaled by the rider. The global market for e-bikes is growing rapidly due to riders with health issues, for use as an advanced training aid, to extend competitive cycling age, and for hill touring with a friend or spouse, for example.Many non-electric bicycles, including common road bicycles and off-road bicycles, may be converted to e-bikes by adding an electric drive system, such as to the rear hub of the bicycle, and a separate battery and control system. Conventional e-bikes, whether converted or originally manufactured, have one or more of a number of problems. Some have batteries that are exposed or semi-exposed. Some may comprise covers or other battery containers that are unsightly and add additional bulk and unnecessary weight to the frame body. Such unsightliness may cause embarrassment to many serious cyclists. Some have batteries that are contained or semi-contained within the frame. However, these require either cutting the frame to create one or more access holes that weaken the frame, resulting in loss of frame stiffness or fatigue life, or they may require extension or other modification of the frame, such as moving the down tube forward and/or down from its traditional position immediately adjacent the bottom bracket, in order to provide for unhindered access to the battery. Any of these configurations may negatively affect the handling, structural integrity, aerodynamics and/or the aesthetic pleasantry of the frame. For at least any of these reasons, many cyclists, including many serious road cyclists, are dis-inclined to ride conventional e-bikes.Accordingly, what is needed is an improved frame for an e-bike with a fully concealed battery integrated into the frame of the bicycle without compromising the structural integrity of the frame.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe disclosed invention relates to bicycles, and particularly to an electric-assist bicycle with a fully concealed battery integrated into the frame of the bicycle without compromising the structural integrity of the frame.Disclosed is a bicycle frame for an e-bike frame, which includes a through opening through a bottom bracket housing of the bicycle frame. Ordinarily, such a through opening through the bottom bracket housing would significantly weaken the bottom bracket housing and the bicycle frame. However, such weakness is overcome in the disclosed bicycle frame by use of a bearing assembly comprising a fully structural component, or structural component assembly, that extends through the length of the bottom bracket housing along the longitudinal axis thereof, to provide the needed strength and durability to compensate for any weakness in the bottom bracket housing due to the through opening. The through opening through the bottom bracket housing provides access to a battery cavity within the down tube. The through opening provides for insertion of a battery into the battery cavity of the down tube or removal of the battery therefrom, when the bearing assembly is removed from the frame. Once the battery is inserted into the battery cavity of the down tube through the through opening, the battery remains stored within the down tube while in use. A battery access cover may be removably coupled to the frame to cover the through opening.Some embodiments may further comprise a charging port for charging the battery without the need of removing the battery. Wiring utilized for such electrical communications between the battery and/or a control panel/controls, and/or an electric drive motor, may be contained within the frame, thereby concealing them from view while in use.Disclosed is bicycle frame that includes a down tube with a battery cavity, a battery positioned within the battery cavity, a bottom bracket housing coupled to the down tube, and a bottom bracket bearing assembly extended through and removably coupled to the bottom bracket housing. In some embodiments, the down tube includes a hollow down tube shell having a down tube first end, a down tube second end opposing the down tube first end, the battery cavity inside the hollow down tube shell, and a down tube longitudinal axis that extends from the down tube first end to the down tube second end. The battery is positioned inside the battery cavity. In some embodiments, the bottom bracket housing is coupled to the down tube second end. In some embodiments, the bottom bracket housing includes a hollow cylindrical shaped housing shell having a housing first end, a housing second end opposing the housing first end, a bearing cavity inside the housing shell, and a housing shell longitudinal axis that extends from the housing first end to the housing second end. The housing shell longitudinal axis is perpendicular to the down tube longitudinal axis, and the bearing cavity opens to the battery cavity. A bottom bracket bearing assembly is extended through and removably coupled to the bottom bracket housing. The bottom bracket bearing assembly prevents the battery from exiting the battery cavity in response to the bottom bracket bearing assembly being coupled to the bottom bracket housing.The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the particular embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSA more complete understanding of the disclosed inventions may be derived by referring to the detailed description and claims when considered in conjunction with the Figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to similar items throughout the Figures, and:FIG.1is a perspective view of a bicycle frame, according to an embodiment;FIG.2is another perspective view of the bicycle frame ofFIG.1;FIG.3is an exploded view of a portion of the bicycle frame ofFIG.1, showing details of a bottom bracket bearing assembly;FIG.4is a side view of a portion of the bicycle frame ofFIG.1, showing details of the bottom bracket housing, wherein a battery is partially inserted into a through opening through the bottom bracket housing and into the down tube, and wherein a battery access cover is removed, according to an embodiment;FIG.5is a side perspective exploded view of a portion of the bicycle frame ofFIG.1, showing details of the bottom bracket housing and bottom bracket bearing assembly, wherein a battery is partially inserted into a through opening through the bottom bracket and into the down tube, and wherein a battery access cover is removed, according to an embodiment;FIG.6is a bottom view of a portion of the bicycle frame ofFIG.1, showing details of the bottom bracket housing, wherein the battery access cover is removably coupled thereto, according to an embodiment; andFIG.7illustrates a method of mounting a battery to a bicycle frame.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTIONAs discussed above, embodiments of the disclosed invention relate to electric and/or electric-assist bicycles, and particularly to a bicycle frame for an electric bicycle with a battery that is fully concealed within the frame of the bicycle without modification of the frame.The bicycle frame of a disclosed e-bike, in a disclosed configuration, includes a top tube, a head tube, forks, a down tube, a seat tube, seat stays, chain stays, and a bottom bracket shell, coupled together to form a conventional double triangle bike frame configuration, wherein a main triangle is defined by the top tube, down tube, and seat tube, and a paired rear triangle is defined by the seat tube, seat stays, and chain stays. The down tube, seat tube, and chain stays converge at a bottom bracket housing, which serves as a critical junction requiring significant strength and durability to withstand significant loads and impact forces acting thereon while in use. In the disclosed invention, the bottom bracket housing also serves as a housing for a crankset bearing assembly. In embodiments of the disclosed invention, the down tube is hollow, and the bottom bracket housing is hollow. A battery is inserted through a through hole in the bottom bracket housing into a battery cavity inside the down tube. A bottom bracket bearing assembly is extended through and removably coupled to the bottom bracket housing.

Often a fork steerer tube is extended throughhead tube26with bicycle forks coupled to the fork steerer tube.Seat tube16is coupled tobottom bracket housing20, andtop tube22is coupled toseat tube16andhead tube26.As shown inFIGS.1and2,down tube14,seat tube16, and chain stays18converge atbottom bracket housing20.Bottom bracket housing20serves as a critical junction point requiring significant strength and durability to withstand significant loads and impact forces acting thereon while in use.Downtube14is hollow. Downtube14includes a hollowdown tube shell50having a down tubefirst end52and a down tubesecond end54opposing down tubefirst end52. Down tubefirst end52is coupled tohead tube26. Down tubesecond end54is coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Downtube14has abattery cavity56inside hollowdown tube shell50. Abattery44is positioned insidebattery cavity56, as shown inFIG.1andFIG.2.Battery44is enclosed indown tube14. Downtube14has a down tubelongitudinal axis58that extends from down tubefirst end52to down tubesecond end54.Bottom bracket housing20ofbicycle frame12is coupled to down tubesecond end54.Bottom bracket housing20is hollow.Bottom bracket housing20includes a hollow cylindrical shapedhousing shell70, best seen inFIG.2andFIG.5. Hollow cylindrical shapedhousing shell70has a housingfirst end72and a housingsecond end74opposing housingfirst end72. Hollow cylindrical shapedhousing shell70is open at each end, with a first bearing opening80in housingfirst end72, and a second bearing opening82in housing second end74(FIG.3). Bearing cavity76(FIG.2) is inside hollow cylindrical shapedhousing shell70.Bearing cavity76is open tobattery cavity56so thatbattery44can slide through bearingcavity76of hollow cylindrical shapedshell70and intobattery cavity56ofdown tube14.Bottom bracket housing20has a housing shelllongitudinal axis78that extends from housingfirst end72to housingsecond end74as shown inFIG.2,FIG.3,FIG.5andFIG.6. Housing shelllongitudinal axis78is perpendicular to down tubelongitudinal axis58.Bottom bracket housing20serves as a housing for a bottombracket bearing assembly34, best seen inFIG.3. Bottombracket bearing assembly34extends through and is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Bottombracket bearing assembly34serves at least two purposes: first, to keepbattery44from exiting downtube14andbottom bracket housing20; and second, to provide structural stability and strength tobicycle frame12.Bottom bracket housing20has three openings into bearingcavity76. First bearingopening80and second bearing opening82oppose each other at housingfirst end72and housingsecond end74, respectively, as seen inFIG.2andFIG.3, for example.Bottom bracket housing20ofbicycle frame12also has a throughopening30, as shown inFIG.3,FIG.4, andFIG.5. Through opening30is the opening thatbattery44is inserted through to extend through bearingcavity76ofbottom bracket housing20and intobattery cavity56ofdown tube14, as shown in the figures. When bottombracket bearing assembly34is not installed inbottom bracket housing20,battery44is installed and removed frombattery cavity56throughbottom bracket housing20and specifically through the throughopening30. Oncebattery44is inserted into throughopening30, through bearingcavity76ofbottom bracket housing20and intobattery cavity56, bottombracket bearing assembly34is inserted throughbottom bracket housing20and removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Bottombracket bearing assembly34preventsbattery44from exiting (being removed from)battery cavity56indown tube14once bottombracket bearing assembly34is extended through, and coupled to,bottom bracket housing20.Ordinarily, a throughopening30throughbottom bracket housing20would significantly weakenbottom bracket housing20, rendering it ineffective. However, such weakness is overcome by the use of bottombracket bearing assembly34. Bottombracket bearing assembly34is extended through the entire length ofbottom bracket housing20along housing shelllongitudinal axis78. Bottombracket bearing assembly34extending through the entire length ofbottom bracket housing20and coupled tobottom bracket housing20provides the additional needed strength and durability to compensate for any weakness inbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30.Bottombracket bearing assembly34is inserted into bottom bracket housing along housing shelllongitudinal axis78. Bottombracket bearing assembly34can take many different forms of bottom bracket assemblies, as is know in the art of bearing assemblies for bicycles. In the embodiment shown in the figures, bottombracket bearing assembly34includes amale bearing cup38, afemale bearing cup36, a pair ofbearings40, and a pair ofouter seals42, as best seen inFIG.3.Male bearing cup38is inserted into bearingcavity76through first bearing opening80along housing shelllongitudinal axis78ofbottom bracket housing20.Female bearing cup36is inserted into bearingcavity76through second bearing opening82along housing shelllongitudinal axis78ofbottom bracket housing20.Male bearing cup38andfemale bearing cup36meet in bearingcavity76, and are coupled to each other, either by press fit or threads or other coupling method.Bearings40andouter seals42are coupled tomale bearing cup38andfemale bearing cup36as is known in the art. Couplingmale bearing cup38tofemale bearing cup36couples bottombracket bearing assembly34tobottom bracket housing20.Bottombracket bearing assembly34may be a BB386 bottom bracket bearing system, a PF30 bottom bracket bearing system, or the like, wherein the complete bearing system comprises a structural component, or structural component assembly, such as a through sleeve, whether threaded or not threaded, a pair of mating threaded sleeves or cups, or the like, that extend through the length of thebottom bracket housing20along the housing shelllongitudinal axis78. Bottombracket bearing assembly34extends through the length of thebottom bracket housing20and provides the needed strength and durability to compensate for weakness inbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30. In some embodiments, bottombracket bearing assembly34may comprise a single structural component that extends through the length ofbottom bracket housing20. In any case, bottombracket bearing assembly34is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20.With bottombracket bearing assembly34removed frombottom bracket housing20,battery44may be inserted into or removed frombattery cavity56ofdown tube14through the bearingcavity76and throughopening30. Oncebattery44is inserted intobattery cavity56ofdown tube14,battery44remains fixed and stored within downtube14.Bicycle frame12also includes abattery access cover32. Battery access cover32is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Battery access cover32covers throughopening30. Battery access cover32may be configured to be friction fit tobicycle frame12, or it may be configured to be removably coupled tobicycle frame12by any other suitable means including, without limitation, mechanically by screws, rivets, bolts, other fastener devices, or the like. In some embodiments, as shown inFIG.6,battery access cover32is removably coupled tobicycle frame12, with battery access cover32shaped to conform to the exterior surface ofbottom bracket shell20, chain stays18, and/orseat tube16, with which it may be in contact.In some embodiments,bicycle frame12includes a charging system for chargingbattery44.

Chargingconnector92is electrically coupled tobattery44in response tobattery44being inserted intobattery cavity56. Chargingconnector92is electrically coupled to chargingport90with anelectrical connection94, as shown inFIG.1andFIG.2. Chargingport90, chargingconnector92, andelectrical connection94are shown in dotted lines because they are optional components. When power is provided to chargingport90andbattery44is electrically connected to chargingconnector92,battery44is charged. Furthermore, in some embodiments,battery44may be in wired or wireless communication with a control panel, and/or controls, (not shown) and an electric drive motor (not shown). In some embodiments, any wiring utilized for such electrical communications may be contained, at least primarily, withinbicycle frame12, thereby concealing them from view while in use.Althoughbattery44of the disclosed bicycle frame is contained withindown tube14in the embodiment shown in the figures, it is contemplated thatbattery44, orbatteries44, may be alternatively contained withinseat tube16and/or chain stay(s)18or other portions ofbicycle frame12without departing from the spirit of the teachings herein. In such alternative embodiments, battery access is via throughopening30throughbottom bracket shell20, wherein any weakness ofbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30therethrough is compensated for, fully or partially, by bottombracket bearing assembly34comprising a structural component, or structural component assembly, extending throughbottom bracket shell20, as described above.It is also contemplated that the disclosed invention, in some embodiments, is not limited to a double triangle frame configuration, as shown in the drawings and described above. The teachings of the disclosed bicycle frame may be equally applied to various other bicycle frame configurations, including, without limitation, certain diamond, step-through, cantilever, recumbent, prone, cross or girder, truss, monocoque, or tandem frames, or the like, whether for road use or off-road use, or any combination thereof.Because access tobattery44is via throughopening30throughbottom bracket housing20, there is no need to cut a battery access hole indown tube14, alter the connection point where downtube14is coupled tobottom bracket housing20, or otherwise alter the geometry ofbicycle frame12, including tube angles and lengths, and/or frame shapes, to accommodatebattery44, thereby maintaining the strength, integrity, and geometry ofbicycle frame12. The disclosedbicycle frame12eliminates the unsightliness of batteries that are coupled to the frame exterior, or only partially inserted into a component ofbicycle frame12, becausebattery44is fully contained withinbicycle frame12, thereby maintaining the aesthetic pleasantry and aerodynamic properties ofbicycle frame12.The components definingbicycle frame12may be formed of any of many different types of materials or combinations thereof that can readily be formed into shaped objects provided that the components selected are consistent with the intended operation ofbicycle frame12. For example, the components may be formed of: rubbers (synthetic and/or natural) and/or other like materials; glasses (such as fiberglass) carbon-fiber, aramid-fiber, any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; polymers such as thermoplastics (such as ABS, Fluoropolymers, Polyacetal, Polyamide; Polycarbonate, Polyethylene, Polysulfone, and/or the like), thermosets (such as Epoxy, Phenolic Resin, Polyimide, Polyurethane, Silicone, and/or the like), any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; composites and/or other like materials; metals, such as copper, zinc, magnesium, titanium, copper, iron, steel, carbon steel, alloy steel, tool steel, stainless steel, aluminum, any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; alloys, such as aluminum alloy, titanium alloy, magnesium alloy, copper alloy, any combination thereof, and/or other like materials; any other suitable material; and/or any combination thereof.Furthermore, the components definingbicycle frame12may be purchased pre-manufactured or manufactured separately and then assembled together.

Bottombracket bearing assembly34extends through the length of thebottom bracket housing20and provides the needed strength and durability to compensate for weakness inbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30. In some embodiments, bottombracket bearing assembly34may comprise a single structural component that extends through the length ofbottom bracket housing20. In any case, bottombracket bearing assembly34is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20.With bottombracket bearing assembly34removed frombottom bracket housing20,battery44may be inserted into or removed frombattery cavity56ofdown tube14through the bearingcavity76and throughopening30. Oncebattery44is inserted intobattery cavity56ofdown tube14,battery44remains fixed and stored within downtube14.Bicycle frame12also includes abattery access cover32. Battery access cover32is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Battery access cover32covers throughopening30. Battery access cover32may be configured to be friction fit tobicycle frame12, or it may be configured to be removably coupled tobicycle frame12by any other suitable means including, without limitation, mechanically by screws, rivets, bolts, other fastener devices, or the like. In some embodiments, as shown inFIG.6,battery access cover32is removably coupled tobicycle frame12, with battery access cover32shaped to conform to the exterior surface ofbottom bracket shell20, chain stays18, and/orseat tube16, with which it may be in contact.In some embodiments,bicycle frame12includes a charging system for chargingbattery44. In the embodiment shown in the figures,bicycle frame12includes an optional chargingport90, chargingconnector92, and chargingelectrical connection94.

Chargingconnector92is electrically coupled tobattery44in response tobattery44being inserted intobattery cavity56. Chargingconnector92is electrically coupled to chargingport90with anelectrical connection94, as shown inFIG.1andFIG.2. Chargingport90, chargingconnector92, andelectrical connection94are shown in dotted lines because they are optional components. When power is provided to chargingport90andbattery44is electrically connected to chargingconnector92,battery44is charged. Furthermore, in some embodiments,battery44may be in wired or wireless communication with a control panel, and/or controls, (not shown) and an electric drive motor (not shown). In some embodiments, any wiring utilized for such electrical communications may be contained, at least primarily, withinbicycle frame12, thereby concealing them from view while in use.Althoughbattery44of the disclosed bicycle frame is contained withindown tube14in the embodiment shown in the figures, it is contemplated thatbattery44, orbatteries44, may be alternatively contained withinseat tube16and/or chain stay(s)18or other portions ofbicycle frame12without departing from the spirit of the teachings herein. In such alternative embodiments, battery access is via throughopening30throughbottom bracket shell20, wherein any weakness ofbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30therethrough is compensated for, fully or partially, by bottombracket bearing assembly34comprising a structural component, or structural component assembly, extending throughbottom bracket shell20, as described above.It is also contemplated that the disclosed invention, in some embodiments, is not limited to a double triangle frame configuration, as shown in the drawings and described above.

This application is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application entitled âBICYCLE FRAM FOR AN E-BIKE,â Ser. No. 17/098,925, filed Nov. 16, 2020, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled âE-BIKE WITH CONCEALED BATTERY,â Ser. No. 62/937,571, filed Nov. 19, 2019, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated entirely herein by reference.

This invention relates generally to bicycle frames for electric and/or electric-assist bicycles, and particularly to a bicycle frame with a battery that is fully concealed within the frame of the bicycle.

An electric bicycle, also known as an e-bike, is a bicycle with an integrated electric motor powered by a battery, which can be used for partial propulsion, while retaining the ability to be pedaled by the rider. The global market for e-bikes is growing rapidly due to riders with health issues, for use as an advanced training aid, to extend competitive cycling age, and for hill touring with a friend or spouse, for example.

Many non-electric bicycles, including common road bicycles and off-road bicycles, may be converted to e-bikes by adding an electric drive system, such as to the rear hub of the bicycle, and a separate battery and control system. Conventional e-bikes, whether converted or originally manufactured, have one or more of a number of problems. Some have batteries that are exposed or semi-exposed. Some may comprise covers or other battery containers that are unsightly and add additional bulk and unnecessary weight to the frame body. Such unsightliness may cause embarrassment to many serious cyclists. Some have batteries that are contained or semi-contained within the frame. However, these require either cutting the frame to create one or more access holes that weaken the frame, resulting in loss of frame stiffness or fatigue life, or they may require extension or other modification of the frame, such as moving the down tube forward and/or down from its traditional position immediately adjacent the bottom bracket, in order to provide for unhindered access to the battery. Any of these configurations may negatively affect the handling, structural integrity, aerodynamics and/or the aesthetic pleasantry of the frame. For at least any of these reasons, many cyclists, including many serious road cyclists, are dis-inclined to ride conventional e-bikes.

Accordingly, what is needed is an improved frame for an e-bike with a fully concealed battery integrated into the frame of the bicycle without compromising the structural integrity of the frame.

The disclosed invention relates to bicycles, and particularly to an electric-assist bicycle with a fully concealed battery integrated into the frame of the bicycle without compromising the structural integrity of the frame.

Disclosed is a bicycle frame for an e-bike frame, which includes a through opening through a bottom bracket housing of the bicycle frame. Ordinarily, such a through opening through the bottom bracket housing would significantly weaken the bottom bracket housing and the bicycle frame. However, such weakness is overcome in the disclosed bicycle frame by use of a bearing assembly comprising a fully structural component, or structural component assembly, that extends through the length of the bottom bracket housing along the longitudinal axis thereof, to provide the needed strength and durability to compensate for any weakness in the bottom bracket housing due to the through opening. The through opening through the bottom bracket housing provides access to a battery cavity within the down tube. The through opening provides for insertion of a battery into the battery cavity of the down tube or removal of the battery therefrom, when the bearing assembly is removed from the frame. Once the battery is inserted into the battery cavity of the down tube through the through opening, the battery remains stored within the down tube while in use. A battery access cover may be removably coupled to the frame to cover the through opening.

Some embodiments may further comprise a charging port for charging the battery without the need of removing the battery. Wiring utilized for such electrical communications between the battery and/or a control panel/controls, and/or an electric drive motor, may be contained within the frame, thereby concealing them from view while in use.

Disclosed is bicycle frame that includes a down tube with a battery cavity, a battery positioned within the battery cavity, a bottom bracket housing coupled to the down tube, and a bottom bracket bearing assembly extended through and removably coupled to the bottom bracket housing. In some embodiments, the down tube includes a hollow down tube shell having a down tube first end, a down tube second end opposing the down tube first end, the battery cavity inside the hollow down tube shell, and a down tube longitudinal axis that extends from the down tube first end to the down tube second end. The battery is positioned inside the battery cavity. In some embodiments, the bottom bracket housing is coupled to the down tube second end. In some embodiments, the bottom bracket housing includes a hollow cylindrical shaped housing shell having a housing first end, a housing second end opposing the housing first end, a bearing cavity inside the housing shell, and a housing shell longitudinal axis that extends from the housing first end to the housing second end. The housing shell longitudinal axis is perpendicular to the down tube longitudinal axis, and the bearing cavity opens to the battery cavity. A bottom bracket bearing assembly is extended through and removably coupled to the bottom bracket housing. The bottom bracket bearing assembly prevents the battery from exiting the battery cavity in response to the bottom bracket bearing assembly being coupled to the bottom bracket housing.

The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the particular embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Bottombracket bearing assembly34serves at least two purposes: first, to keepbattery44from exiting downtube14andbottom bracket housing20; and second, to provide structural stability and strength tobicycle frame12.

Bottom bracket housing20has three openings into bearingcavity76. First bearingopening80and second bearing opening82oppose each other at housingfirst end72and housingsecond end74, respectively, as seen inFIG.2andFIG.3, for example.Bottom bracket housing20ofbicycle frame12also has a throughopening30, as shown inFIG.3,FIG.4, andFIG.5. Through opening30is the opening thatbattery44is inserted through to extend through bearingcavity76ofbottom bracket housing20and intobattery cavity56ofdown tube14, as shown in the figures. When bottombracket bearing assembly34is not installed inbottom bracket housing20,battery44is installed and removed frombattery cavity56throughbottom bracket housing20and specifically through the throughopening30. Oncebattery44is inserted into throughopening30, through bearingcavity76ofbottom bracket housing20and intobattery cavity56, bottombracket bearing assembly34is inserted throughbottom bracket housing20and removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Bottombracket bearing assembly34preventsbattery44from exiting (being removed from)battery cavity56indown tube14once bottombracket bearing assembly34is extended through, and coupled to,bottom bracket housing20.

Ordinarily, a throughopening30throughbottom bracket housing20would significantly weakenbottom bracket housing20, rendering it ineffective. However, such weakness is overcome by the use of bottombracket bearing assembly34. Bottombracket bearing assembly34is extended through the entire length ofbottom bracket housing20along housing shelllongitudinal axis78. Bottombracket bearing assembly34extending through the entire length ofbottom bracket housing20and coupled tobottom bracket housing20provides the additional needed strength and durability to compensate for any weakness inbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30.

Bottombracket bearing assembly34is inserted into bottom bracket housing along housing shelllongitudinal axis78. Bottombracket bearing assembly34can take many different forms of bottom bracket assemblies, as is know in the art of bearing assemblies for bicycles. In the embodiment shown in the figures, bottombracket bearing assembly34includes amale bearing cup38, afemale bearing cup36, a pair ofbearings40, and a pair ofouter seals42, as best seen inFIG.3.Male bearing cup38is inserted into bearingcavity76through first bearing opening80along housing shelllongitudinal axis78ofbottom bracket housing20.Female bearing cup36is inserted into bearingcavity76through second bearing opening82along housing shelllongitudinal axis78ofbottom bracket housing20.Male bearing cup38andfemale bearing cup36meet in bearingcavity76, and are coupled to each other, either by press fit or threads or other coupling method.Bearings40andouter seals42are coupled tomale bearing cup38andfemale bearing cup36as is known in the art. Couplingmale bearing cup38tofemale bearing cup36couples bottombracket bearing assembly34tobottom bracket housing20.

Bottombracket bearing assembly34may be a BB386 bottom bracket bearing system, a PF30 bottom bracket bearing system, or the like, wherein the complete bearing system comprises a structural component, or structural component assembly, such as a through sleeve, whether threaded or not threaded, a pair of mating threaded sleeves or cups, or the like, that extend through the length of thebottom bracket housing20along the housing shelllongitudinal axis78. Bottombracket bearing assembly34extends through the length of thebottom bracket housing20and provides the needed strength and durability to compensate for weakness inbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30. In some embodiments, bottombracket bearing assembly34may comprise a single structural component that extends through the length ofbottom bracket housing20. In any case, bottombracket bearing assembly34is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20.

With bottombracket bearing assembly34removed frombottom bracket housing20,battery44may be inserted into or removed frombattery cavity56ofdown tube14through the bearingcavity76and throughopening30. Oncebattery44is inserted intobattery cavity56ofdown tube14,battery44remains fixed and stored within downtube14.

Bicycle frame12also includes abattery access cover32. Battery access cover32is removably coupled tobottom bracket housing20. Battery access cover32covers throughopening30. Battery access cover32may be configured to be friction fit tobicycle frame12, or it may be configured to be removably coupled tobicycle frame12by any other suitable means including, without limitation, mechanically by screws, rivets, bolts, other fastener devices, or the like. In some embodiments, as shown inFIG.6,battery access cover32is removably coupled tobicycle frame12, with battery access cover32shaped to conform to the exterior surface ofbottom bracket shell20, chain stays18, and/orseat tube16, with which it may be in contact.

In some embodiments,bicycle frame12includes a charging system for chargingbattery44. In the embodiment shown in the figures,bicycle frame12includes an optional chargingport90, chargingconnector92, and chargingelectrical connection94. Chargingport90is coupled to a down tube outsidesurface51ofdown tube14. Chargingconnector92is coupled to a down tube insidesurface53ofdown tube14. Chargingconnector92is electrically coupled tobattery44in response tobattery44being inserted intobattery cavity56. Chargingconnector92is electrically coupled to chargingport90with anelectrical connection94, as shown inFIG.1andFIG.2. Chargingport90, chargingconnector92, andelectrical connection94are shown in dotted lines because they are optional components. When power is provided to chargingport90andbattery44is electrically connected to chargingconnector92,battery44is charged. Furthermore, in some embodiments,battery44may be in wired or wireless communication with a control panel, and/or controls, (not shown) and an electric drive motor (not shown). In some embodiments, any wiring utilized for such electrical communications may be contained, at least primarily, withinbicycle frame12, thereby concealing them from view while in use.

Althoughbattery44of the disclosed bicycle frame is contained withindown tube14in the embodiment shown in the figures, it is contemplated thatbattery44, orbatteries44, may be alternatively contained withinseat tube16and/or chain stay(s)18or other portions ofbicycle frame12without departing from the spirit of the teachings herein. In such alternative embodiments, battery access is via throughopening30throughbottom bracket shell20, wherein any weakness ofbottom bracket housing20due to throughopening30therethrough is compensated for, fully or partially, by bottombracket bearing assembly34comprising a structural component, or structural component assembly, extending throughbottom bracket shell20, as described above.

It is also contemplated that the disclosed invention, in some embodiments, is not limited to a double triangle frame configuration, as shown in the drawings and described above. The teachings of the disclosed bicycle frame may be equally applied to various other bicycle frame configurations, including, without limitation, certain diamond, step-through, cantilever, recumbent, prone, cross or girder, truss, monocoque, or tandem frames, or the like, whether for road use or off-road use, or any combination thereof.

Because access tobattery44is via throughopening30throughbottom bracket housing20, there is no need to cut a battery access hole indown tube14, alter the connection point where downtube14is coupled tobottom bracket housing20, or otherwise alter the geometry ofbicycle frame12, including tube angles and lengths, and/or frame shapes, to accommodatebattery44, thereby maintaining the strength, integrity, and geometry ofbicycle frame12. The disclosedbicycle frame12eliminates the unsightliness of batteries that are coupled to the frame exterior, or only partially inserted into a component ofbicycle frame12, becausebattery44is fully contained withinbicycle frame12, thereby maintaining the aesthetic pleasantry and aerodynamic properties ofbicycle frame12.
