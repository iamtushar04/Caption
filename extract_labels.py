DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Various exemplary embodiments and details are described hereinafter, with reference to the figures when relevant. It should be noted that the figures may or may not be drawn to scale and that elements of similar structures or functions are represented by like reference numerals throughout the figures. It should also be noted that the figures are only intended to facilitate the description of the embodiments. They are not intended as an exhaustive description of the invention or as a limitation on the scope of the invention. In addition, an illustrated embodiment needs not have all the aspects or advantages shown. An aspect or an advantage described in conjunction with a particular embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment and can be practiced in any other embodiments even if not so illustrated, or if not so explicitly described.
Throughout this disclosure, the words ‚Äústoma‚Äù and ‚Äúostomy‚Äù are used to denote a surgically created opening bypassing the intestines or urinary tract system of a person. The words are used interchangeably, and no differentiated meaning is intended. The same applies for any words or phrases derived from these, e.g. ‚Äústomal‚Äù, ‚Äúostomies‚Äù etc. Also, the solid and liquid wastes emanating from the stoma may be referred to as both stomal ‚Äúoutput,‚Äù ‚Äúwaste(s),‚Äù and ‚Äúfluids‚Äù interchangeably. A subject having undergone ostomy surgery may be referred to as ‚Äúostomist‚Äù or ‚Äúostomate‚Äù‚Äîmoreover, also as ‚Äúpatient‚Äù or ‚Äúuser‚Äù. However, in some cases ‚Äúuser‚Äù may also relate or refer to a health care professional (HCP), such as a surgeon or an ostomy care nurse or others. In those cases, it will either be explicitly stated, or be implicit from the context that the ‚Äúuser‚Äù is not the ‚Äúpatient‚Äù him- or herself.
In the following, whenever referring to proximal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the skin-facing side or surface, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. Likewise, whenever referring to the distal side or surface of a layer, an element, a device or part of a device, the referral is to the side or surface facing away from the skin, when a user wears the ostomy appliance. In other words, the proximal side or surface is the side or surface closest to the user, when the appliance is fitted on a user and the distal side is the opposite side or surface‚Äîthe side or surface furthest away from the user in use.
The axial direction is defined as the direction of the stoma, when a user wears the appliance. Thus, the axial direction is generally perpendicular to the skin or abdominal surface of the user.
The radial direction is defined as perpendicular to the axial direction. In some sentences, the words ‚Äúinner‚Äù and ‚Äúouter‚Äù may be used. These qualifiers should generally be perceived with respect to the radial direction, such that a reference to an ‚Äúouter‚Äù element means that the element is farther away from a centre portion of the ostomy appliance than an element referenced as ‚Äúinner‚Äù. In addition, ‚Äúinnermost‚Äù should be interpreted as the portion of a component forming a centre of the component and/or being adjacent to the centre of the component. In analogy, ‚Äúoutermost‚Äù should be interpreted as a portion of a component forming an outer edge or outer contour of a component and/or being adjacent to that outer edge or outer contour.
The use of the word ‚Äúsubstantially‚Äù as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply mean that any deviations are within tolerances that would normally be expected by the skilled person in the relevant field.
The use of the word ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù as a qualifier to certain features or effects in this disclosure is intended to simply mean‚Äîfor a structural feature: that a majority or major portion of such feature exhibits the characteristic in question, and‚Äîfor a functional feature or an effect: that a majority of outcomes involving the characteristic provide the effect, but that exceptionally outcomes do no provide the effect.
The present disclosure relates to an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices. Further, methods related to the ostomy system and devices thereof are disclosed. An accessory device (also referred to as an external device) may be a mobile phone or other handheld device. An accessory device may be a personal electronic device, e.g. a wearable, such as a watch or other wrist-worn electronic device. An accessory device may be a docking station. The docking station may be configured to electrically and/or mechanically couple the monitor device to the docking station. The docking station may be configured for charging the monitor device and/or configured for transferring data between the monitor device and the docking station. The ostomy system may comprise a server device. The server device may be operated and/or controlled by the ostomy appliance manufacturer and/or a service centre.
The present disclosure provides an ostomy system and devices thereof, such as an ostomy appliance, a base plate for an ostomy appliance, a monitor device, and optionally one or more accessory devices which either alone or together facilitate reliable determination of the nature, severity and rapidness of moisture propagation in the adhesive material provided for attaching the base plate to the skin surface of a user. Depending on the nature of the pattern of moisture propagation in the adhesive, the ostomy system and devices thereof enable providing information to the user about the type of failure, and in turn enable providing an indication to the user of the severity and thus the remaining time frame for replacing the ostomy appliance without experiencing severe leakage and/or skin damage.
The ostomy appliance comprises a base plate and an ostomy pouch (also referred to as an ostomy bag). The ostomy appliance may be a colostomy appliance, an ileostomy appliance or a urostomy appliance. The ostomy appliance may be a two-part ostomy appliance, i.e. the base plate and the ostomy pouch may be releasably coupled e.g. with a mechanical and/or an adhesive coupling, e.g. to allow that a plurality of ostomy pouches can be utilized (exchanged) with one base plate. Further, a two-part ostomy appliance may facilitate correct application of the base plate to skin, e.g. to an improved user sight of the stomal region. The ostomy appliance may be a one-part ostomy appliance, i.e. the base plate and the ostomy pouch may be fixedly attached to each other. The base plate is configured for coupling to a user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma, such as a peristomal skin area.
The ostomy appliance includes a base plate, such as a monolithic, one-piece base plate, e.g. integrated with a sensor assembly part, or a base plate and a separate sensor assembly part, such as a sensor assembly part to be subsequently applied to a base plate. For example, to allow an arbitrary base plate, such as a conventional base plate, to achieve the features as described herein. Features as described with respect to the base plate herein may be provided by a sensor assembly part to be applied to a base plate, e.g. by the user. A sensor assembly part may be adapted to adhere to an ostomy plate.
A disclosed method of attaching a base plate to a user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma, such as the peristomal skin area, may comprise attaching a sensor assembly part to a base plate and attaching the base plate, e.g. together with the attached sensor assembly part, to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma, such as the peristomal skin area. Alternatively, the method of attaching the base plate to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma may comprise attaching the sensor assembly part to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma and attaching the base plate to the user's stoma and/or skin surrounding the stoma above the attached sensor assembly part.
The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part comprises a first adhesive layer, also denoted center adhesive layer. During use, the first adhesive layer adheres to the user's skin (peristomal area) and/or to additional seals, such as sealing paste, sealing tape and/or sealing ring. Thus, the first adhesive layer may be configured for attachment of the base plate and/or the sensor assembly part to the skin surface of a user. The first adhesive layer may have a stomal opening, such as a first adhesive stomal opening, with a center point.
The first adhesive layer may be made of a first composition. The first composition may comprise one or more polyisobutenes and/or styrene-isoprene-styrene. The first composition may comprise one or more hydrocolloids. The first composition may comprise one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids.
The first composition may be a pressure sensitive adhesive composition suitable for medical purposes comprising a rubbery elastomeric base and one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids. The first composition may comprise one or more polybutenes, one or more styrene copolymers, one or more hydrocolloids, or any combination thereof. The combination of the adhesive properties of the polybutenes and the absorbing properties of the hydrocolloids renders the first composition suitable for use in ostomy appliances. The styrene copolymer may for example be a styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer or a styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer. Preferably, one or more styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block type copolymers are employed. The amount of styrene block-copolymer may be from 5% to 20% of the total adhesive composition. The butene component is suitably a conjugated butadiene polymer selected from polybutadiene, polyisoprene. The polybutenes are preferably present in an amount of from 35-50% of the total adhesive composition. Preferably, the polybutene is polyisobutylene (PIB). Suitable hydrocolloids for incorporation in the first composition are selected from naturally occurring hydrocolloids, semisynthetic hydrocolloids and synthetic hydrocolloids. The first composition may comprise 20-60% hydrocolloids. A preferred hydrocolloid is carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The first composition may optionally contain other components, such as fillers, tackifiers, plasticizers, and other additives.
The first adhesive layer may have a plurality of sensor point openings. A sensor point opening of the first adhesive layer is optionally configured to overlap a part of an electrode, e.g. to form a sensor point.
The sensor point openings of the first adhesive layer may comprise primary sensor point openings. The primary sensor point openings may comprise one or more primary first sensor point openings and one or more primary second sensor point openings, the primary first sensor point openings configured to overlap parts of an electrode and the primary second sensor point openings configured to overlap parts of another electrode different from the electrode at least partly overlapped by the primary first sensor point openings.
The sensor point openings of the first adhesive layer may comprise secondary sensor point openings. The secondary sensor point openings may comprise one or more secondary first sensor point openings and one or more secondary second sensor point openings, the secondary first sensor point openings configured to overlap parts of an electrode and the secondary second sensor point openings configured to overlap parts of another electrode different from the electrode at least partly overlapped by the secondary first sensor point openings.
The sensor point openings of the first adhesive layer may comprise tertiary sensor point openings. The tertiary sensor point openings may comprise one or more tertiary first sensor point openings and one or more tertiary second sensor point openings, the tertiary first sensor point openings configured to overlap parts of an electrode and the tertiary second sensor point openings configured to overlap parts of another electrode different from the electrode at least partly overlapped by the tertiary first sensor point openings.
The first adhesive layer may have a substantially uniform thickness. The first adhesive layer may have a thickness in the range from 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm, e.g. in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.2 mm.
The first adhesive layer may have a primary thickness in a primary part of the first adhesive layer, e.g. in a primary region within a primary radial distance or in a primary radial distance range from the center point of the stomal opening. The primary thickness may be in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.5 mm. such as about 1.0 mm. The primary radial distance may be in the range from 20 mm to 50 mm, such as in the range from 25 mm to 35 mm, e.g. 30 mm.
The first adhesive layer may have a secondary thickness in a secondary part of the first adhesive layer, e.g. in a secondary region outside a secondary radial distance or in a secondary radial distance range from the center point of the stomal opening. The secondary thickness may be in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm, such as about 0.5 mm. The secondary radial distance may be in the range from 20 mm to 50 mm, such as in the range from 25 mm to 35 mm, e.g. 30 mm.
The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part may comprise a second layer. The second layer may be a second adhesive layer, also denoted rim adhesive layer. The second layer may have a second radial extension that is larger than a first radial extension of the first adhesive layer at least in a first angular range of the base plate and/or the sensor assembly part. Accordingly, a part of a proximal surface of the second layer may be configured for attachment to the skin surface of a user. The part of a proximal surface of the second layer configured for attachment to the skin surface of a user is also denoted the skin attachment surface of the second adhesive layer. The second layer may have a stomal opening, such as a second layer stomal opening and/or a second adhesive stomal opening, with a center point.
The second adhesive layer may be made of a second composition. The second composition may comprise one or more polyisobutenes and/or styrene-isoprene-styrene. The second composition may comprise one or more hydrocolloids. The second composition may comprise one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids.
The second composition may be a pressure sensitive adhesive composition suitable for medical purposes comprising a rubbery elastomeric base and one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids. The second composition may comprise one or more polybutenes, one or more styrene copolymers, one or more hydrocolloids, or any combination thereof. The combination of the adhesive properties of the polybutenes and the absorbing properties of the hydrocolloids renders the second composition suitable for use in ostomy appliances. The styrene copolymer may for example be a styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer or a styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer. Preferably, one or more styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block type copolymers are employed. The amount of styrene block-copolymer may be from 5% to 20% of the total adhesive composition. The butene component is suitably a conjugated butadiene polymer selected from polybutadiene, polyisoprene. The polybutenes are preferably present in an amount of from 35-50% of the total adhesive composition. Preferably, the polybutene is polyisobutylene (PIB). Suitable hydrocolloids for incorporation in the second composition are selected from naturally occurring hydrocolloids, semisynthetic hydrocolloids and synthetic hydrocolloids. The second composition may comprise 20-60% hydrocolloids. A preferred hydrocolloid is carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The second composition may optionally contain other components, such as fillers, tackifiers, plasticizers, and other additives.
Different ratio of contents may change properties of the first and/or second adhesive layers. The second adhesive layer and the first adhesive layer may have different properties. The second adhesive layer (second composition) and the first adhesive layer (first composition) may have different ratios of polyisobutenes, styrene-isoprene-styrene, and/or hydrocolloids. For example, the second adhesive layer may provide a stronger attachment to the skin compared to attachment to the skin provided by the first adhesive layer. Alternatively or additionally, the second adhesive layer may be thinner than the first adhesive layer. Alternatively or additionally, the second adhesive layer may be less water and/or sweat absorbing than the first adhesive layer. Alternatively or additionally, the second adhesive layer may be less mouldable than the first adhesive layer. The second adhesive layer may provide a second barrier against leakage.
The second layer may have a substantially uniform thickness. The second layer may have a thickness in the range from 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm, e.g. in the range from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm, such as 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, or 0.7 mm.
The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part may comprise one or more electrodes, such as a plurality of electrodes, such as two, three, four, five, six, seven or more electrodes. The sensor assembly part may be applied to the base plate, such as to provide the base plate with the one or more electrodes.
The electrodes, e.g. some or all the electrodes, may be arranged between the first adhesive layer and the second adhesive layer. The electrodes may be arranged in an electrode assembly, e.g. an electrode layer. An electrode comprises a connection part for connecting the electrodes to other components and/or interface terminals. An electrode may comprise one or more conductor parts and/or one or more sensing parts. The electrode assembly may be arranged between the first adhesive layer and the second adhesive layer. The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part, e.g. the electrode assembly, may comprise a first electrode, a second electrode and optionally a third electrode. The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part, e.g. the electrode assembly, may comprise a fourth electrode and/or a fifth electrode. The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part, e.g. the electrode assembly, optionally comprises a sixth electrode. The base plate and/or the sensor assembly part, e.g. the electrode assembly, may comprise a ground electrode. The ground electrode may comprise a first electrode part. The first electrode part of the ground electrode may form a ground for the first electrode. The ground electrode may comprise a second electrode part. The second electrode part of the ground electrode may form a ground for the second electrode. The ground electrode may comprise a third electrode part. The third electrode part of the ground electrode may form a ground for the third electrode. The ground electrode may comprise a fourth electrode part.

Thereby, the protrusions 316 accounts for the sensor point openings (e.g. sensor point openings 260, 262, 264 of FIG. 8 ) of the first adhesive layer 200, and the first elevated part 314 accounts for the first part 302, such as the primary side of the first part 302, of the electrode assembly not being covered by the first adhesive layer 200.
Furthermore, the first adhesive layer 200 may typically show viscous properties, and the release liner 206 having the protrusions 316 and the first elevated part 314 provides that shape of the first adhesive layer 200, including the sensor point openings, is maintained while the release liner 206 is maintained.
The optional masking element 218 may be provided to insulate the plurality of electrodes 216, or parts of the plurality of electrodes 216. The masking element 218 has a plurality of terminal openings 318 to allow connection to the connecting parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes 216, e.g. from a proximal side of the electrode assembly 204.
As described in respect to FIG. 3 , some parts of the illustrated base plate 4, may be provided as a separate assembly to be applied to an existing base plate, e.g. comprising one or more of the components as described, such as to provide a base plate like the base plate 4 as described. For example, a sensor assembly part 700 may be provided, e.g. comprising the electrode assembly 204, the first adhesive layer 200 and the release liner 206. Additionally, the sensor assembly part 700 may also comprise the second adhesive layer 202 and/or the top layer 208. It may be envisioned that the user may provide a hole in layers of the base plate whereto the sensor assembly part 700 is to be applied, to allow for connection between the plurality of electrodes 216 of the electrode assembly 204 and terminals of a monitor device being coupled to the base plate 4.
FIG. 12 illustrates an exploded view of an exemplary electrode assembly 204 of a base plate and/or a sensor assembly part, such as the base plate 4 or sensor assembly part 700 of FIG. 11 . The electrode assembly 204 has a distal side 204A and a proximal side 204B. The electrode assembly comprises a support layer 214 with a proximal side 214B and a distal side 214A. The electrode assembly 204 comprises a plurality of electrodes 216. Each electrode of the plurality of electrodes 216 has a respective connection part 217 for connecting the electrodes 216 to respective terminal elements of the monitor interface. The electrodes 216 are provided, such as formed, on the proximal side 214B of the support layer 214, e.g. the electrodes 216 may be positioned on the proximal side 214B of the support layer 214. Further, electrode assembly 204 optionally comprises a masking element 218 with proximal side 218B and configured to insulate electrode parts of electrodes 216 from the first adhesive layer 200 of the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700 (see FIG. 11 ). The masking element 218 covers or overlap with parts of the electrodes 216 when seen in the axial direction, e.g. from the proximal side 204B. The masking element 218 may be configured not to cover or overlap the connecting parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes.
In some exemplary electrode assembly 204, such as the electrode assembly 204 of FIG. 12 , the electrode assembly 204 comprises a reinforcement element 308. The reinforcement element 308 may be positioned proximal to the electrode assembly 216, such as proximal to the plurality of electrodes 216, such as proximal to the plurality of connection parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes 216. The reinforcement element 308 may form at least part of a first part of the electrode assembly 204. The reinforcement element 308 may be provided with openings 310 to provide conductive pathways between sides of the reinforcement element 308, such as between a proximal side 308B and a distal side 308A of the reinforcement element 308.
FIG. 13 shows an alternative to FIG. 12 , wherein the reinforcement element 308 comprises a plurality of conductive paths 311. For example, the reinforcement element 308 may be a flex circuit. The plurality of conductive paths 311 may be connected to the plurality of electrodes 216. The plurality of conducive paths 311 thereby may form the connection parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes 216. The plurality of conductive paths 311 may provide conductive pathways between the proximal side 308B and the distal side 308A of the reinforcement element 308.
FIG. 14 shows an exemplary electrode configuration 220 of the plurality of electrodes 216, like the electrode configuration 220 as shown in FIG. 6 , with the difference that the connection parts 217, such as the ground connection part 222A, the first connection part 224A, the second connection part 226A, the third connection part 228A, the fourth connection part 230A and/or the fifth connection part 232A, are straight connector parts.
FIG. 15 , shows a sectional schematic representation of part of a base plate 4 and/or a sensor assembly part 700. The base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700 comprises a first adhesive layer 200, an optional second adhesive layer 202, and a top layer 208. An electrode assembly 204 comprising a plurality of electrodes 216 is arranged between the first adhesive layer 200 and the top layer 208, such as between the first adhesive layer 200 and the second adhesive layer 202. For example, a second part of the electrode assembly 204 is arranged between the first adhesive layer 200 and the second adhesive layer 202 and/or the top layer 208. The electrode assembly 204 further comprises an optional reinforcement element 308 and an optional release liner 206.
The first adhesive layer 200 is provided such that it does not cover a primary side of a first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204. For example, the release liner 206 comprises a first elevated part 314 such as to facilitate the formation of the first adhesive layer 202 to not cover the primary side of the first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204. The primary side of the first part 302 may be a proximal side of the first part 302. The first part 302 includes the connection parts of the plurality of electrodes 216 and the reinforcement element 308 or part of the reinforcement element 308. The first part 302 may include part of the support layer 214.
FIG. 16 , shows a sectional schematic representation of part of a base plate 4 and/or a sensor assembly part 700 as shown in FIG. 15 , further illustrating that the connection parts 217 may be accessible, e.g. by slightly bending the first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204 in a distal direction. Alternatively, the release liner 206 may be removed so the first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204 is accessible from a proximal side.
Because the first adhesive layer 200 is not covering the first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204, the first part 302 is not adhered to the release liner or any other proximally positioned layers. Therefore, the connection parts 217 may be accessible, e.g. for connection with a monitor device. Connection to the connection parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes 216 may be provided through the reinforcement element 308, or the connection parts 217 may be formed by conductive paths of the reinforcement element 308.
FIG. 17 , shows a sectional schematic representation of part of a base plate 4 and/or a sensor assembly part 700. The base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700 comprises a first adhesive layer 200, an optional second adhesive layer 202, and a top layer 208. An electrode assembly 204 comprising a plurality of electrodes 216 is arranged between the first adhesive layer 200 and the top layer 208, such as between the first adhesive layer 200 and the second adhesive layer 202. For example, a second part of the electrode assembly 204 is arranged between the first adhesive layer and the second adhesive layer 202/the top layer 208. Although not illustrated, the electrode assembly 204 may comprise a reinforcement element 308, e.g. as illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16 . Thus, the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700 of FIG. 17 may correspond to the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700, respectively, of FIGS. 15 and 16 .
The first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204, together with the top layer 208 and the optional second adhesive layer, has been turned over to expose the connection parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes 216 on a distal side of the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700. Thus, the primary side of the first part 302 initially being a proximal side (as shown in FIG. 15 ) is, after the first part 302 has been turned, facing distally.
FIG. 18 , shows a sectional schematic representation of part of a base plate 4 and/or a sensor assembly part 700 as shown in FIG. 17 , wherein the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700 comprises a coupling part 210. The coupling part 210 is configured for forming a mechanical connection between the monitor device and the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700. The first part 302 of the electrode assembly 204 is extending into the coupling part 210, e.g. to allow the monitor device, such as terminals of the monitor device to connect to the electrodes 216 of the base plate 4 and/or the sensor assembly part 700. The coupling part 210 is positioned to cover the connection parts 217 of the plurality of electrodes 216. The coupling part 210 may be attached to the top layer 208 and/or the coupling part 210 may be attached to the electrode assembly 204.

Assembling 1010 the top layer, the optional second adhesive layer, the electrode assembly and the first adhesive layer includes assembling such that the electrode assembly is arranged between the first adhesive layer and the top layer and/or between the first adhesive layer and the optional second adhesive layer. For example, assembling 1010 the top layer, the optional second adhesive layer, the electrode assembly and the first adhesive layer includes assembling such that the second part of the electrode assembly, e.g. comprising sensing parts of the plurality of electrodes, is arranged between the first adhesive layer and the second adhesive layer/the top layer.

The coupling part may be provided 1016 to be aligned with the first part of the electrode assembly.
The method 1000 furthermore optionally comprises providing 1018 a release liner. The first adhesive layer may be provided 1008 on the release liner. For example, the first adhesive layer may be provided 1008, such as formed, on the release liner by scraping of a first composition, such as a first adhesive composition. The release liner may comprise a first elevated part for forming an area not covered by the first adhesive layer. The first elevated part and consequently the area not covered by the first adhesive layer may be aligned with the first part of the electrode assembly, such that the first adhesive layer does not cover the first part of the electrode assembly.
The position of the first connector on the base plate and/or the sensor assembly part, the number of terminals and the position of the terminals in the coupling part may be adapted to the electrode configuration used in the electrode assembly of the base plate and/or the sensor assembly part.
