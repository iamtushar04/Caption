FIG. 23 shows a partially enlarged conductive pattern 540 of a conventional defroster apparatus disclosed in JP2011-216378A and JP2012-151116A. In the conventional defroster apparatus, the conductive pattern 540 includes a plurality of connection elements 544 that extend between two branch points 542 to define opening areas 543. Each connection element 544 is formed of one straight line. The inventors of the present invention have conducted extensive studies on the defroster apparatus having such a connection element 544 and found that the conductive pattern 540 including the connection elements 544 may be visible to an observer (e.g., a passenger such as a driver), because of the shape of each connection element 544 formed of one straight line. When light such as outside light incident on the defroster apparatus enters a side surface formed of a flat surface of the connection element 544, the light incident on each position of the side surface is reflected on the side surface in substantially a certain direction. The reflected light is visible to an observer so that the conductive pattern 540 including the connection elements 544 is visible to the observer. The fact that the conductive pattern 540 including the connection elements 544 is visible to the observer such as a driver deteriorates a visibility of the observer through the pane.
As shown in FIG. 1, an automobile 1 as an example of a vehicle includes panes such as a front window, a rear window and side windows. Herein, a front window 5 is formed of a heating plate 10 by way of example. In addition, the automobile 1 includes a power source 7 such as a battery. Heating plates 110, 210, 310 and 410 according to the other embodiments described below can be applied to the automobile of FIG. 1.
[0225]
FIG. 2 shows the heating plate 10 viewed in a normal direction of a plate plane thereof. In addition, FIG. 3 shows a cross-sectional view corresponding to a line III-III of the heating plate 10 of FIG. 2. In the example shown in FIG. 3, the heating plate 10 includes a pair of glass plates 11, 12, a conductive pattern sheet (pattern sheet) 20 disposed between the pair of glass plates 11, 12, a joint layer 13 (connecting layer 13) that joins (connects) the glass plate 11 and the conductive pattern sheet 20, and a joint layer 14 that joins the glass plate 12 and the conductive pattern sheet 20. In the example shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the heating plate 10 is curved. However, FIG. 3 and FIGS. 13 to 20 planarly show the heating plate 10 and the glass plates 11, 12, for simplifying the illustration and facilitating the understanding.
[0226]
The conductive pattern sheet 20 includes a sheet-like substrate 30, a conductive pattern 40 formed on the substrate 30, a wiring part 15 for powering the conductive pattern 40, and a connection part 16 connecting the conductive pattern 40 and the wiring part 15.
[0227]
In the example shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the conductive pattern 40 is powered by the power source 7, such as a battery, through the wiring part 15 and the connection part 16, so that the conductive pattern 40 generates heat by means of resistance heat. The heat generated by the conductive pattern 40 is transmitted to the glass plates 11, 12 through the joint layers 13, 14, so that the glass plates 11, 12 are warmed up. Thus, dew drops on the glass plates 11, 12 can be removed so that the glass plates 11, 12 can be defogged. When there is snow or ice on the glass plates 11, 12, the snow or ice can be unfrozen. Thus, an excellent field of view of a passenger can be ensured.
[0228]
Particularly when used as a front window of an automobile, the glass plate 11, 12 preferably has a high visible light transmittance, in order not to hinder a field of view of a passenger. A material of such a glass plate 11, 12 may be soda lime glass, blue plate glass (float glass) and so on, for example. The glass plate 11, 12 preferably has a transmittance of 90% or more in a visible light area. The visible light transmittance of the glass plate 11, 12 is specified as follows. Transmittance of light with measurement wavelength range of from 380 nm to 780 nm is measured by using a spectrophotometer (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation, “UV-3100PC”, compliant with JIS K 0115). The visible light transmittance is an average value of the transmittances at the respective wavelengths. The visible light transmittance may be lowered by partially or totally coloring the glass plate 11, 12, for example. In this case, direct sunlight can be shielded and an inside of the automobile is less visible from outside.
[0229]
In addition, the glass plate 11, 12 preferably has a thickness of not less than 1 mm and not more than 5 mm. With such a thickness, the glass plate 11, 12 excellent in strength and optical properties can be obtained.
[0230]
The glass plates 11, 12 and the conductive pattern sheet 20 are joined to each other through the joint layers 13, 14, respectively. As such a joint layer 13, 14, a layer made of a material having various adhesion properties or gluing (pressure sensitive adhesive) properties can be employed. In addition, the joint layer 13, 14 preferably has a high visible light transmittance. A typical joint layer may be a layer made of polyvinyl butyral (PVB), for example. The joint layer 13, 14 preferably has a thickness of not less than 0.15 mm and not more than 0.7 mm.
[0231]
Not limited to the illustrated example, the heating plate 10 may be provided with another function layer for exerting a specific function. In addition, one function layer may exert two or more functions. Alternatively, for example, a function may be given to at least one of the glass plate 11, 12 of the heating plate 10, the joint layer 13, 14 thereof, and the substrate 30 of the conductive pattern sheet 20 thereof, which is described later. The function that can be given to heating plate 10 may be an antireflection (AR) function, a hard coat (HC) function having an abrasion resistance, an infrared ray shield (reflection) function, an ultraviolet ray shield (reflection) function, a polarizing function, an antifouling function and so on, for example.
[0232]
Next, the conductive pattern sheet 20 is described. The conductive pattern sheet 20 includes the sheet-like substrate 30, the conductive pattern 40 disposed on the substrate 30, the wiring part 15 for powering the conductive pattern 40, and the connection part 16 connecting the conductive pattern 40 and the wiring part 15. The conductive pattern 40 is formed by arranging thin conductive wires made of metal or the like in a predetermined pattern. The conductive pattern sheet 20 may have a planar dimension substantially the same as that of the glass plate 11, 12 so as to be placed all over the heating plate 10. Alternatively, the conductive pattern sheet 20 may be placed over only a part of the heating plate 10, such as a part in front of a driver's seat.
[0233]
The sheet-like substrate 30 functions as a substrate that supports the conductive pattern 40. The substrate 30 is an electrically insulating substrate that transmits light of a wavelength (380 nm to 780 nm) of a visible light wavelength band, which is generally recognized as transparent.
[0234]
Although any resin transmitting visible light can be used as a resin to be contained in the substrate 30, a thermoplastic resin may be preferably used. The thermoplastic resin may be an acryl resin made of, e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, a polyester resin made of, e.g., polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate or amorphous polyethylene terephthalate (A-PET), a polyethylene resin, a polyolefin resin made of, e.g., polypropylene, a cellulose-based resin made of, e.g., triacetyl cellulose (cellulose triacetate), a polystyrene or polycarbonate resin, an AS resin and so on, for example. In particular, an acryl resin and a polyvinyl chloride are preferred because of their excellent etching resistance, weather resistance and light resistance.
[0235]
In addition, in consideration of support property and light transmission of the conductive pattern 40, the substrate 30 preferably has a thickness of not less than 0.03 mm and not more than 0.3 mm.
[0236]
The conductive pattern 40 is described with reference to FIGS. 4 to 6. The conductive pattern 40 is powered by the power source 7, such as a battery, through the wiring part 15 and the connection part 16, so as to generate heat by means of resistance heat. The heat is transmitted to the glass plates 11, 12 through the joint layers 13, 14, so that the glass plates 11, 12 are warmed up.
[0237]
A first feature of the conductive pattern 40 in this embodiment is a shape typically shown in the plan view of FIG. 5. The conductive pattern 40 includes a plurality of connection elements 44 that extend between two branch points 42 to define a number of opening areas 43. Such opening areas 43 have random shapes and are arranged at random pitches. Typically, the opening areas 43 have shapes which do not have a repeated regularity (periodic regularity), and are arranged at pitches which do not have a repeated regularity (periodic regularity). A second feature of the conductive pattern 40 in this embodiment resides in that a rate of a sum of lengths of straight line segments of the connection elements 44 connecting the two branch points 42, relative to a sum of lengths of the connection elements 44 over the whole area of the conductive pattern 40, is less than 20%. Herebelow, this fact can also be expressed that “a rate of the connection elements, which are straight line segments connecting the two branch points, relative to the plurality of connection elements, is less than 20%”.
[0238]
The conductive pattern 40 having the above two features is typically formed by determining a reference pattern 50 formed of a plurality of ling segments 54 that extend between two branch points 52 to define opening areas 53, then determining positions of the branch points 42 of the conductive pattern 40 based on the branch points 52 of the reference pattern 50, and thereafter by determining positions of the connection elements 44 of the conductive pattern 40 based on the determined branch points 42 of the conductive pattern 40 and the line segments 54 of the reference pattern 50.
[0239]
FIG. 4 is a plan view showing the reference pattern 50. As shown in FIG. 4, the reference pattern 50 is a mesh-like pattern defining a number of the opening areas 53. The reference pattern 50 includes a plurality of the line segments 54 that extend between the two branch points 52 to define the opening areas 53. Namely, the reference pattern 50 is an aggregation of a number of the line segments 54 each forming the branch points 52 at both ends thereof.
[0240]
In the example shown in FIG. 4, a number of the opening areas 53 of the reference pattern 50 have shapes which do not have a repeated regularity (periodic regularity) and are arranged at pitches which do not have a repeated regularity (periodic regularity). Particularly in the illustrated example, the opening areas 53 are arranged so as to correspond to respective Voronoi areas in a Voronoi diagram obtained from generatrix points whose position coordinates in a plane have a predetermined random distribution. These randomly distributed generatrix points have a feature in which a distance between two adjacent generatrix points is distributed between a predetermined upper limit value and a predetermined lower limit value. In other words, the respective line segments 54 of the reference pattern 50 correspond to respective boundaries of the Voronoi areas in such a Voronoi diagram. In addition, the respective branch points 52 of the reference pattern 50 correspond to Voronoi points in the Voronoi diagram.
[0241]
Since the Voronoi diagram can be obtained by the known methods disclosed in JP2012-178556A, JP2011-216378A and JP2012-151116A, for example, detailed description of the method of creating the Voronoi diagram is omitted herein.
[0242]
FIG. 5 shows, in enlargement, a part of the conductive pattern 40 together with the reference pattern 50 shown in FIG. 4. Firstly, the respective branch points 42 of the conductive pattern 40 are disposed on the respective branch points 52 of the reference pattern 50. Then, the respective connection elements 44 of the conductive pattern 40 are disposed so as to connect the two branch points 42 corresponding to the two branch points 52 forming both ends of the line segments 54 of the reference pattern 50. Each connection element 44 may be formed to have a linear shape (straight line segment), a curved shape or a shape formed by combining these shapes. For example, each connection element 44 may be formed to have a linear shape (straight line segment), an arcuate shape, a polygonal line shape, a corrugated shape and so on. A rate of the connection elements 44 which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, is less than 20%. Namely, 80% or more of the connection elements 44 have a shape other than a linear shape (straight line segment), such as an arcuate shape, a polygonal line shape, a corrugated shape and so on.
[0243]
In the example shown in FIG. 5, the conductive pattern 40 includes a plurality the branch points 42 arranged on the respective branch points 52 of the reference pattern 50, and a plurality of the connection elements 44 that extend between the two branch points 42 to define the opening areas 43. A rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, is less than 20%. The conductive pattern 40 has a mesh-like pattern in which the plurality of connection elements 44 are arranged correspondingly to the respective line segments 54 of the reference pattern 50.
[0244]
It is not necessary to specify a rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, by checking all the area of the conductive pattern 40 and calculating the rate. Actually, it is possible to check the suitable number of elements to be checked in consideration of dispersion degree of elements, in a certain section having a planar dimension (an area) that is considered to be capable of reflecting a general tendency of a rate of the connection elements, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, and calculate the rate. A value which was thus specified can be handled as a rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44. In the conductive pattern 40 in this embodiment, by observing 100 points included in an area of 300 mm×300 mm by means of an optical microscope or an electron microscope, a rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44 can be specified.
[0245]
The material for constituting such a conductive pattern 40 may be selected from one or more of gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminum, chrome, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, palladium, indium, tungsten and an alloy thereof, for example.
[0246]
In the example shown in FIG. 3, the connection element 44 has a surface 44 a on the side of the substrate 30, a surface 44 b on the side opposed to the substrate 30, and side surfaces 44 c and 44 d. The connection element 44 has substantially a rectangular section in general. A width W of the connection element 44, i.e., the width W along the sheet plane of the substrate 30 is preferably not less than 1 μm and not more than 15 μm. Since the connection element 44 having such a width W is sufficiently thin, the conductive pattern 40 can be effectively made invisible. In addition, a height (thickness) H of the connection element 44, i.e., the height (thickness) H along the normal direction to the sheet plane of the substrate 30 is preferably not less than 1 μm and not more than 20 μm. Further, the height H of the connection element 44 is more preferably not less than 2 μm and not more than 20 μm. The height (thickness) of the connection element 44 can be said as a height (thickness) of the conductive pattern 40. Due to the connection element 44 having such a thickness (height) H, a sufficient conductivity can be ensured while a suitable resistance value is provided.
[0247]
According to the above-described conductive pattern 40, as shown in FIG. 6, light incident on the side surface of the connection element 44 having a shape other than a linear shape (straight line segment), such as an arcuate shape, a polygonal line shape, a corrugated shape and so on, is reflected irregularly on the side surface. Thus, it can be restrained that the light incident on the side surface of the connection element 44 from a certain direction is reflected on the side surface in a certain direction correspondingly to the incident direction. Thus, it can be restrained that the reflected light is visible to an observer, so that the conductive pattern 40 having the connection elements 44 is visible to the observer. In particular, a rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, is less than 20%. That is to say, 80% or more of the plurality of connection elements 44 have a shape other than a linear shape (straight line segment), such as an arcuate shape, a polygonal line shape, a corrugated shape and so on. In this case, it can be more effectively restrained that light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 44 is visible to an observer, so that the conductive pattern 40 having the connection elements 44 is visible to the observer.
[0248]
In addition, when the connection element 44 has the height (thickness) H of not less than 1 μm, in particular, when the connection element 44 has the height H of not less than 2 μm, the light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 44 is more likely to be visible to an observer. Thus, in this case, in order to restrain that the light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 44 is visible to the observer, it is particularly effective that a rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, is made to be less than 20%.
[0249]
Further, when a distribution of the opening areas 43 is sparse so that an average length Dave between centers of gravity between the two adjacent opening areas 43 is longer, the length of each connection element 44 is also longer. When the length of each connection element 44 is longer, light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 44 in a certain direction is more visible. According to the research of the present inventors, when the average distance Dave between the centers of gravity between the two adjacent opening areas 43 is 80 μm or more, light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 44 tends to be visible to an observer. The average distance Dave may be 70 μm or more. Thus, in this case, in order to restrain that the light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 44 is visible to the observer, it is particularly effective that a rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, is made to be less than 20%. The two adjacent opening areas 43 mean two adjacent opening areas 43 which share one connection element 44. In addition, the distance D between centers of gravity G1, G2 means a linear distance between the centers of gravity G1, G2.
[0250]
The average distance Dave between the centers of gravity between the two adjacent opening areas 43 is preferably 300 μm or less. When the average distance Dave between the centers of gravity between the two adjacent opening areas 43 is not less than 80 μm and not more than 300 μm, a line width of the connection element (thin conductive wire) 44 can be sufficiently thinned so as to be invisible, and calorific values at respective positions of the conductive pattern 40 can be sufficiently made uniform.
[0251]
In the example shown in FIG. 3, the connection element 44 includes a first dark color layer 63 disposed on the substrate 30, a conductive metal layer 61 disposed on the first dark color layer 63, and a second dark color layer 64 disposed on the conductive metal layer 61. In other words, the surface of the conductive metal layer 61, which is located on the side of the substrate 30, is covered with the first dark color layer 63, and the surface of the conductive metal layer 61, which is located on the side opposed to the substrate 30, and both the side surfaces thereof are covered with the second dark color layer 64. The dark color layer 63, 64 may be a layer having a visible light reflectance lower than that of the conductive metal layer 61. For example, the dark color layer 63, 64 is a layer of a dark color such as black color. Owing to the dark color layers 63, 64, the conductive meal layer 61 can be more invisible, whereby a field of view of a passenger can be more suitably ensured.
[0252]
Next, an example of a manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 is described with reference to FIGS. 7 to 13. FIGS. 7 to 13 are sectional views showing the example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 in sequence.
[0253]
Firstly, the sheet-like substrate 30 is prepared. The substrate 30 is an electrically insulating resin substrate that transmits light of a wavelength (380 nm to 780 nm) of a visible light wavelength band, which is generally recognized as transparent.
[0254]
Then, as shown in FIG. 7, the first dark color layer 63 is disposed on the substrate 30. For example, the first dark color layer 63 can be disposed on the substrate 30 by a plating method including electrolytic plating and electroless plating, a spattering method, a CVD method, a PVD method, an ion plating method or a combination method of the two or more methods. Various known materials may be used as material of the first dark color layer 63. For example, the material may be copper nitride, copper oxide, nickel nitride and so on.
[0255]
Next, as shown in FIG. 8, the conductive metal layer (conductive layer) 61 is disposed on the first dark color layer 63. As described above, the conductive metal layer 61 is a layer made of one or more of gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminum, chrome, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, palladium, indium, tungsten and an alloy thereof. The conductive metal layer 61 may be formed by a known method. For example, there is employed a method of adhering a metal foil such as a copper foil by means of a weather-resistant adhesive or the like, a plating method including electrolytic plating and electroless plating, a spattering method, a CVD method, a PVD method, an ion plating method or a combination method of the two or more methods.
[0256]
When the conductive metal layer 61 is formed of a metal foil such as a copper foil, the following method may be employed. Namely, the first color layer 63 is formed previously on one surface of the metal foil in advance. Then, the metal foil with the first dark color layer 63 is laminated on the substrate 30 through an adhesive layer or a gluing layer (pressure sensitive adhesive layer), such that the first color layer 63 faces the substrate 30. In this case, the first dark color layer 63 may be formed as follows. By subjecting a part of a material constituting the metal foil to a darkening treatment (blackening treatment), the first dark color layer 63 made of metallic oxide or metallic sulfide can be formed from the part constituting the metal foil. Alternatively, the first dark color layer 63 as a coating film made of a dark color material or a plated layer made of nickel or chrome may be disposed on a surface of the metal foil. In addition, the surface of the metal foil may be roughened, and the first dark color layer 63 may be disposed thereon.
[0257]
Then, as shown in FIG. 9, a resist pattern 62 is disposed on the conductive metal layer 61. The resist pattern 62 is a pattern that corresponds to a pattern of the conductive pattern 40 to be formed. In the method described herein, the resist pattern 62 is disposed only on a portion where the conductive pattern 40 is finally to be formed. The resist pattern 62 may be formed by a pattering method using a known photolithographic technique.
[0258]
Then, as shown in FIG. 10, the conductive metal layer 61 and the first dark color layer 63 are etched with the resist pattern 62 serving as a mask. Due to this etching process, the conductive metal layer 61 and the first color layer 63 can be patterned substantially similar to the resist pattern 62. The etching method is not particularly limited, and a known method may be employed. The known method may be a wet etching method using etchant, a plasma etching method and so on. Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 11, the resist pattern 62 is removed.
[0259]
After that, as shown in FIG. 12, the second dark color layer 64 is formed on the surface 44 b of the conductive metal layer 61 on the side opposed to the substrate 30 and the side surfaces 44 c, 44 d. The second dark color layer 64 may be formed as follows. By subjecting a part of a material constituting the conductive metal layer 61 to a darkening treatment (blackening treatment), the second dark color layer 64 made of metallic oxide or metallic sulfide can be formed from the part constituting the conductive metal layer 61. Alternatively, the second dark color layer 64 as a coating film made of a dark color material or a plated layer made of nickel or chrome may be disposed on a surface of the metal foil. In addition, the surface of the conductive metal layer 61 may be roughened, and the second dark color layer 64 may be disposed thereon.
[0260]
In the manner as described above, the conductive pattern sheet 20 shown in FIG. 12 is manufactured.
[0261]
Finally, the glass plate 11, the joint layer 13, the conductive pattern sheet 20, the joint layer 14 and the glass plate 12 are superposed in this order, and heated/pressurized. In the example shown in FIG. 13, firstly, the joint layer 13 is provisionally attached to the glass plate 11, and the joint layer 14 is provisionally attached to the glass plate 12. Then, the glass plate 11 to which the joint layer 13 has been provisionally attached, the conductive pattern sheet 20, the glass plate 12 to which the joint layer 14 has been provisionally attached, are superposed in this order and heated/pressurized, in such a manner that the side of the glass plate 11, to which the joint layer 13 has been provisionally attached, and the side of the glass plate 12, to which the joint layer 14 has been provisionally attached, face the conductive pattern sheet 20. Thus, the glass plate 11, the conductive pattern sheet 20 and the glass plate 12 are joined through the joint layers 13, 14, so that the heating plate 10 shown in FIG. 3 is manufactured.
[0262]
The aforementioned heating plate 10 in the first embodiment includes the pair of glass plates 11, 12, the conductive pattern 40 disposed between the pair of glass plates 11, 12 and defining the plurality of opening areas 43, and the joint layers 13, 14 disposed between the conductive pattern 40 and at least one of the pair of glass plates 11, 12. The conductive pattern 40 includes the plurality of connection elements 44 that extend between the two branch points 42 to define the opening areas 43. A rate of the connection elements 44, which are straight line segments connecting the two branch points 42, relative to the plurality of connection elements 44, is less than 20%.
[0263]
According to such a heating plate 10, as shown in FIG. 6, light incident on the side surface of the connection element 44 having a shape other than a linear shape (straight line segment), such as an arcuate shape, a polygonal line shape, a corrugated shape and so on, is reflected irregularly on the side surface. Thus, it can be restrained that the light incident on the side surface of the connection element 44 from a certain direction is reflected on the side surface in a certain direction correspondingly to the incident direction. Thus, it can be restrained that the reflected light is visible to an observer, so that the conductive pattern 40 having the connection elements 44 is visible to the observer.
[0264]
The above first embodiment can be variously modified. Modification examples are described herebelow with reference suitably to the drawings. In the below description and the drawings for the description, a component that can be similarly made as the above embodiment is shown by the same symbol as a component corresponding to the above embodiment, and overlapped description is omitted.
[0265]
A modification example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 is described with reference to FIGS. 14 to 18. FIGS. 14 to 18 are sectional views showing the modification example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 in sequence.
[0266]
Firstly, the conductive pattern sheet 20 is manufactured. The conductive pattern sheet 20 may be manufactured by the method as described above in the example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10.
[0267]
Then, the glass plate 11, the joint layer 13 and the conductive pattern sheet 20 are superposed in this order, and heated/pressurized. In the example shown in FIG. 14, the joint layer 13 is provisionally attached to the glass plate 11 firstly. Then, the glass plate 11 to which the joint layer 13 has been provisionally attached is superposed from the side of the conductive pattern 40 of the conductive pattern sheet 20 and heated/pressurized, in such a manner that the side of the glass plate 11, to which the joint layer 13 has been provisionally attached, faces the conductive pattern sheet 20. Thus, as shown in FIG. 15, the glass plate 11 and the conductive pattern sheet 20 are joined (provisionally joined or completely joined) through the joint layer 13.
[0268]
Then, as shown in FIG. 16, the substrate 30 of the conductive pattern sheet 20 is removed. For example, during the manufacture of the conductive pattern sheet 20, a peeling layer is formed on the substrate 30, and the conductive pattern 40 is formed on the peeling layer. Preferably, the peeling layer is not removed in the step in which the conductive metal layer 61 and the first dark color layer 63 are etched. In this case, the substrate 30 is joined to the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13 through the peeling layer. In the step in which the substrate 30 is removed from the conductive pattern sheet 20, the substrate 30 of the conductive pattern sheet 20 is peeled from the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13 by means of the peeling layer.

The peeling layer may be, for example, a peeling layer of an interface peeling type, a peeling layer of an interlayer peeling type, a peeling layer of a cohesion peeling type and so on. As a peeling layer of an interface peeling type, there may be suitably used a peeling layer having relatively a lower adhesive property to the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13, than an adhesive property to the substrate 30. Such a layer may be a silicone resin layer, a fluororesin layer, a polyolefin resin layer and so on. In addition, it is possible to use a peeling layer having relatively a lower adhesive property to the substrate 30, than an adhesive property to the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13. A peeling layer of an interlayer peeling type may be, for example, a peeling layer including a plurality of film layers, and having relatively a lower adhesive property between the plurality of layers, than an adhesive property to the conductive pattern 40, the joint layer 13 and the substrate 30. A peeling layer of a cohesion peeling type may be, for example, a peeling layer formed by dispersing fillers as a dispersal phase in a base resin as a continuous phase.
[0270]
When a peeling layer of an interface peeling type including a layer having relatively a lower adhesive property to the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13, than an adhesive property to the substrate 30, is used, a peeling phenomenon occurs between the peeling layer, and the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13. In this case, it is possible to make the peeling layer not remain on the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13. Namely, the substrate 30 is removed together with the peeling layer. When the substrate 30 and the peeling layer are removed in this manner, the joint layer 13 is exposed into the opening areas 43 of the conductive pattern 40.
[0271]
On the other hand, when a peeling layer of an interface peeling type having relatively a lower adhesive property to the substrate 30, than an adhesive property to the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13, is used, a peeling phenomenon occurs between the peeling layer and the substrate 30. When a peeling layer of an interlayer peeling type including a plurality of film layers, and having relatively a lower adhesive property between the plurality of layers, than an adhesive property to the conductive pattern 40, the joint layer 13 and the substrate 30, is used, a peeling phenomenon occurs between the plurality of layers. When a peeling layer of a cohesion peeling type, which is formed by dispersing fillers as a dispersal phase in a base resin as a continuous phase, is used, a peeling phenomenon occurs in the peeling layer by cohesion failure.

Finally, the glass plate 11, the joint layer 13 and the conductive pattern 40, the joint layer 14, and the glass plate 12 are superposed in this order, and heated/pressurized. In the example shown in FIG. 17, the joint layer 14 is attached to the glass plate 12 firstly. Then, the glass plate 11, the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13, and the glass plate 12 to which the joint layer 14 has been provisionally attached are superposed in this order and heated/pressurized, in such a manner that the side of the glass plate 12, to which the joint layer 14 has been provisionally attached, faces the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13. Thus, the glass plate 11, the conductive pattern 40, the glass plate 12 are joined (completely joined) through the joint layers 13, 14, whereby the heating plate 10 shown in FIG. 18 is manufactured.
[0273]
According to the heating plate 10 shown in FIG. 18, the heating plate 10 can be free of substrate 30. Thus, the thickness of the heating plate 10 as a whole can be reduced. In addition, the number of boundary faces in the heating plate 10 can be reduced. Thus, deterioration of optical properties, i.e., deterioration of visibility can be restrained.
[0274]
Next, another modification example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 is described with reference to FIGS. 19 and 20. FIGS. 19 and 20 are sectional views showing the other modification example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 in sequence.
[0275]
Firstly, by the same steps as those of the above modification example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10, the glass plate 11 and the conductive pattern sheet 20 are joined (provisionally joined) through the joint layer 13. Then, the substrate 30 is removed therefrom. Namely, the laminate of glass plate 11, the conductive pattern 40 and the joint layer 13 is obtained, which is described in the above modification example of the manufacturing method of the heating plate 10 with reference to FIG. 16.
[0276]
Then, as shown in FIG. 19, the glass plate 11, the joint layer 13 and the conductive pattern 40, and the glass plate 12 are superposed in this order, and heated/pressurized. Thus, the glass plate 11 and the conductive pattern 40 are joined (completely joined) through the joint layer 13, and the glass plate 11 and the glass plate 12 are joined (completely joined) through the joint layer 13. Thus, the heating plate 10 shown in FIG. 20 is manufactured.
[0277]
According to the heating plate 10 shown in FIG. 20, the heating plate 10 can be free of the substrate 30 and the joint layer 14. Thus, the thickness of the heating plate 10 as a whole can be further reduced. In addition, the number of boundary faces in the heating plate 10 can be further reduced. Thus, deterioration of optical properties, i.e., deterioration of visibility can be furthermore effectively restrained. Moreover, since the conductive pattern 40 and the glass plate 12 are in contact with each other, a heating efficiency of the glass plate 12 by the conductive pattern 40 can be increased.
[0278]
As another modification example, FIG. 21 shows a modification example of the reference pattern. As shown in FIG. 21, a reference pattern 80 is a mesh-like pattern defining a number of opening areas 83. The reference pattern 80 includes a plurality of line segments 84 that extend between two branch points 82 to define the opening areas 83. Namely, the reference pattern 80 is an aggregation of a number of the line segments 84 each forming the branch points 82 at both ends thereof. Particularly in the illustrated example, the reference pattern 80 has a shape obtained by elongating the reference pattern 50 shown in FIG. 4 along a first direction (X). In other words, the reference pattern 80 has a shape obtained by compressing the reference pattern 50 shown in FIG. 4 along a second direction (Y) perpendicular to the first direction (X).
[0279]
A part of a conductive pattern 70, which is determined by the method described above with reference to FIG. 5, based on the reference pattern 80 is shown in enlargement in FIG. 22 together with a corresponding part of the reference pattern 80. In the example shown in FIG. 22, the conductive pattern 70 includes a plurality of branch points 72 arranged on the respective branch points 82 of the reference pattern 80, and a plurality of connection elements 74 that extend between the two branch points 72 to define opening areas 73. A rate of the connection elements 74, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 72, relative to the plurality of connection elements 74, is less than 20%. The conductive pattern 70 has a mesh-like pattern on which the plurality of connection elements 74 are arranged correspondingly to the respective line segments 84 of the reference pattern 80.
[0280]
In the example shown in FIG. 22, an average of ratio (L1/L2) of a length L1 of each opening area 73 of the conductive pattern 70 along the first direction (X), relative to a length L2 of the opening area 73 along the second direction (Y) perpendicular to the first direction (X), is not less than 1.3 and not more than 1.8. When the conductive pattern 70 includes the opening area 73 of such a dimension, light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 74 is more likely to be visible to an observer. Thus, in this case, in order to restrain that the light reflected on the side surface of the connection element 74 is visible to the observer, it is particularly effective that a rate of the connection elements, which are straight lines (straight line segments) connecting the two branch points 72, relative to the plurality of connection elements 74 is made to be less than 20%.
[0281]
It is not necessary to specify the respective dimensions of the conductive pattern 40, 70, such as an average distance Dave between centers of gravity of the two adjacent opening areas 43, and an average of ratio (L1/L2) of a length L1 of each opening area 73 of the conductive pattern 70 along the first direction (X) relative to a length L2 of the opening area 73 along the second direction (Y) perpendicular to the first direction (X), by checking all the areas of the conductive pattern 40, 70 and calculating average values. Actually, it is possible to check the suitable number of elements to be checked (an average distance Dave between centers of gravity of the two adjacent opening areas 43, and an average of ratio (L1/L2) of a length L1 of each opening area 73 of the conductive pattern 70 along the first direction (X) relative to a length L2 of the opening area 73 along the second direction (Y) perpendicular to the first direction (X)) in consideration of dispersion degree of elements to be checked, in a certain section having a planar dimension (an area) that is considered to be capable of reflecting a general tendency of the elements to be checked, and calculate average values. Values which were thus specified can be handled as an average distance Dave between centers of gravity of the two adjacent opening areas 43, and an average of ratio (L1/L2) of a length L1 of each opening area 73 of the conductive pattern 70 along the first direction (X) relative to a length L2 of the opening area 73 along the second direction (Y) perpendicular to the first direction (X). In the conductive pattern 40, 70 in this embodiment, by observing 100 points included in an area of 300 mm×300 mm by means of an optical microscope or an electron microscope, and calculating average values, respective dimensions of the conductive pattern 40, 70 can be specified.
[0282]
As an anther modification example, in the above-described first embodiment, the conductive pattern 40, 70 has a pattern determined based on the Voronoi diagram, i.e., a number of the opening areas 53, 83 which have shapes which do not have a repeated regularity (periodic regularity) and are arranged at pitches which do not have a repeated regularity (periodic regularity). However, not limited to this pattern, there may be used, as the conductive pattern, various patterns such as a pattern in which triangular, rectangular, or hexagonal opening areas of the same shape are regularly arranged, a pattern in which opening areas of different shapes are regularly arranged, and so on.
[0283]
In addition, in the example shown in FIGS. 7 to 20, the second dark color layer 64 provides the surface 44 b of the connection element 44, which is opposed to the substrate 30, and the side surfaces 44 c, 44 d thereof. However, not limited thereto, the second dark color layer 64 may provide only the surface 44 b of the connection element 44, which is opposed to the substrate 30, or the side surfaces 44 c, 44 d thereof. When the second dark color layer 64 provides only the surface 44 b of the connection element 44, which is opposed to the substrate 30, the second dark color layer 64 and the resist pattern 62 are disposed in this order on the conductive metal layer (conductive layer) 61, after the step shown in FIG. 8, for example. Thereafter, the second dark color layer 64, the conductive metal layer 61 and the first dark color layer 63 may be etched with the resist pattern 62 serving as a mask. Alternatively, when the second dark color layer 64 provides only the side surfaces 44 c, 44 d of the connection element 44, the second dark color layer 64 is formed without removing the resist pattern 62, after the step shown in FIG. 10, for example, and thereafter the resist pattern 62 is removed. When the first dark color layer 63 is not necessary, the step of disposing the first dark color layer 63 on the substrate 30, which is shown in FIG. 7, may be omitted.
